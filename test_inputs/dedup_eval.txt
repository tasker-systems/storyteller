I approach the fence slowly, watching the old man work in his garden.
I call out a greeting and ask if he remembers a satyr who once passed this way.
I take the flute from my pack and hold it up so he can see it.
I play a few notes — the same melody I taught the boy, years ago.
I set the flute on the fence post between us and wait.
