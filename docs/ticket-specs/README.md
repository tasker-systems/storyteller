# Ticket Specs

Implementation plans, milestones, and process documentation for the storyteller engine.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a branch or feature effort. Documents within capture the planning, execution, and decisions made during implementation — a record of process alongside the code.

## Active

| Directory | Branch | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [`narrator-centric-pivot/`](narrator-centric-pivot/) | `jcoletaylor/agent-prototyping` | In progress | Architectural revision from multi-LLM agents to single Narrator with ML prediction |

## Conventions

- One directory per branch or feature effort
- `_overview.md` — session goals, phase map, decision log
- `phase-N-*.md` — per-phase specification and retrospective
- Documents evolve: specs are drafted before work begins, updated with outcomes after
- Link to technical docs (`docs/technical/`, `docs/foundation/`) rather than duplicating design rationale
