# Now - The Other Bank

I cannot leap the width of the stream, but it is not deep. I take socks and shoes from my feet and I wade across, the current swift but only against my shins, not even to my knees. The stones are smooth and not easy to walk quickly across, and my feet are shocked with the cold of the water.

As I reach the center, not more than a few steps, I see two banks before me, two paths into the woods, overlaid atop one another, or beside one another, I cannot tell. One is dark and shadowed, and seems to curve beyond the heavy body of an old tree that bulges out toward the path. The sunlight does not reach but in diffuse shifting shadows, and the smell somehow carries here, a heavy and humid scent of marsh and stagnant water. The other path stretches gently ahead, carrying up a small slope to a hilly rise, and the sun breaks through the trees easily, showing dancing patterns of brightness through the canopy. The Wolf has already climbed the rise and looks back toward me.

I want to follow the Wolf, the bright bank feels inviting and safe. But my eyes will not stop following the curve beyond the body of the twisted tree. I call to the Wolf, hesitating. “There are two banks. My feet want to step to the darker of the two, though I myself want to follow your own path. Tell me Wolf, why the higher path and not the low?”

The Wolf looks at me strangely, if any look could be said noticeably other. “Low?”

I nod. I take one step toward it, then another. The Wolf begins to slip from view somehow, the higher path becoming thin and diffuse. I step to the darker shore and the Wolf is gone, the higher path, gone. For a moment I am too surprised to be frightened, but not a long moment. I cry out “Wolf! Wolf!?” But there is no answer, no low grumbling sound in my head or ears. Looking about, the stream ripples and rolls clear and bright behind me. The path though low and curving out of sight is well trod and ready before me.

I am not ready to walk this path alone, and I quickly step over slick and rounded stones back into the stream’s current, and soon I can see the Wolf again, and the lighter bank. The Wolf has in these short moments returned from the rise and is back down the path to the edge.

“Where did you go, child?”

“To the other bank.”

“There is no other bank.”

“There is.” I point, and the Wolf looks, but clearly passes it by with his gaze.

“Nothing.”

I place my hand on the Wolf’s shoulder as he steps back into the water, and I point. The Wolf’s ears lie flat and a deep growl of surprise crawls up the back of its throat. The sound startles me and I pull my hand back and step away. The Wolf shakes its great head, and looks back at me.

“How can you see what I cannot?”

“I do not know.”

“Show me again.”

“Will you growl at me again?”

“I did not growl at you. That path was not there before.”

“It is the true bank, though. My feet want to walk me to its shore.”

The Wolf huffs through his nose. I place my hand at his shoulder again, and his breathing catches before returning steady, but he does not growl.

“Bewitched.”

I shrug. “Perhaps.”

“Lead, then, child.”

I walk us together to the other, darker shore. The Wolf’s paws step from water to rocks and onto the dirt of the long low curving path in time with my steps. Unexpectedly my hand on his shoulder seems a comfort, or a steadying force - there is a hesitancy to his footfalls.

“I see both shores, both paths. It is difficult to have my feet find the ground.”

I nod, but it feels firm and sure under my feet. “Come, we will walk further away from the stream. Perhaps it will be more steady, further in.”

Perhaps a dozen paces, the Wolf pulls away from my hand and shakes himself, and snorts and sniffs the air, and paws at the ground to the side of the trail, snuffling into the earth. He looks at me again after a time.

“This is real, in a way the other path was not. I did not think to question. Powerful. My eyes should not be so easily fooled.”

He looks at me again, the question clear, how I could see what he did not. I do not say anything. I do not have anything I know to reveal.
