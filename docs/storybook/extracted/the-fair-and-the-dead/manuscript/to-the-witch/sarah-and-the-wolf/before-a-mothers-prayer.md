# Before - A Mother's Prayer

Kate glances up to see Sarah coming down the small sandy path between the grasses. She smiles at her daughter, sincerely and with warmth, but her face is drawn with grief and worry for her dying son, and her eyes fall back to the flow of the stream where she sits. The rise and fall of the current as it passes matches the whispers of Kate’s prayers, always half-sung to the sound of the babbling water. She prays and sings day in and out, even in gentler times, though now the sound of her grief catches up in her voice and adds an unusual quality, one Sarah does not often hear. There is something aching and almost uncanny in it, and for a moment this scene that Sarah knows so well feels strange, as if being held up by her mind as a memory to make overtly, as it might not come again. A thought she does not treasure, or even understand, and she shakes it away, but the mood holds even as the notion fades.

“I must go, mother.”

“Where, child?” Kate reaches out her hand and takes Sarah’s in her own, and pulls her gently down to sit beside her at the water’s edge.

“Adam says that Tommy is not sick, not with fever the way it seems. He says Tommy is lost.”

Kate looks into the water, and for a moment the clouds overhead break, and there is a dazzle of sunlight that sparkles and flashes in the current, and reflecting flickers over her face, illuminating sorrow but something different only than melancholy. The sense of uncanny slips over Sarah again and then fades, and the clouds close back in overhead.

Eventually Kate nods. “Adam… is wise, in his way. I trust that if he believes this, it is at least truth in part.” She turns to look at Sarah and squeezes her hand. “But you did not answer. Where are you going, my little girl?”

“Into the Wood.”

“And why? What do you hope to find?”

“Tommy. If he is lost, perhaps he dreams himself too deep into the Wood. I will walk the paths I know, and perhaps those I do not, and see if I can find him.”

Kate places her fingertips in the running water, a gesture Sarah has seen a hundred, a thousand times. And for the first it seems as if the water does not just bend and flow about her mother’s touch, but rises as if to meet it, whirl or eddy in greeting, before flowing on. “If I forbid you, as your mother, would you listen, and remain? Or will you tell me yes, only to leave by night?”

Sarah tilts her head and thinks, before replying. She looks into her mother’s eyes. “I will go, whatever you say. I love you. Please do not think it is only willfulness.”

Kate gives a soft smile, and nods. “You are my daughter, and your father’s even more.” She looks at Sarah, directly, and she says softly, with a cracking voice, “I cannot lose you both.”

Sarah is suddenly overcome and throws herself into her mother’s lap, wrapping her arms about her waist. And she is not given to tears here and now, but it is something like it when she finds her throat tight and her face hot, and she squeezes her mother, holding on.

“What if Tommy is alone, mother? What if he is scared? What if his spirit wanders and is lost on trails too far from home, and does not know the way?”

Kate strokes her hair gently, and she does cry, her tears down her face and splashing into her daughter’s dark braids. “I cannot leave him here, fevering. I cannot be away from him long, or he will die.”

Sarah sits up slowly and looks at her mother. For a moment she sees something flowing between her mother, herself, and off to the distance toward the house, but then it is gone, her eyes clear. “What are you doing for him, mother?”

“Only what I can, sweet child.”

“Then I must go, and find him, and bring him home.”

Kate touches Sarah’s cheek. “You are very brave. You… must not tell your father, before you go. He will stop you. I will tell him, and his anger will be with me.”

“Could he come with me?”

“Your father cannot enter the deep Wood. He is a strong and capable man, and kind, and he has made a gentle and full life for us here. But he does not have the eyes anymore to see - perhaps when he is old, he will learn to see again. But his feet will not find the paths, and they will hide themselves from him, and from you if he is with you.”

Sarah nods. She feels as if she knew this already, or had known it before and remembered.

“What should I bring?”

“Dress for cold nights, and bring what bread you can put in your bag. Wear your sturdy shoes and your brother’s old work pants - do not travel in your dress, it will be too much trouble. Bring a candle but no flint, you will find the flame you need. Bring a chain of silver and my small silken pouch. Roll and pack a wool blanket, and find a sturdy stick.”

Sarah leans in again to hug her mother, and Kate hugs her in return.

“And one final thing. Remove your shoes and socks for a moment.”

Sarah does not understand, but she does as she is asked. Kate reaches into the water, and baptizes her feet, bathing them in the stream. Again there is a shimmering, and Kate is whisper-singing prayers, rising and falling as they always do, just at the border of hearing, of understanding. Sarah cannot find the words in the air but she feels them.

Kate nods. “There. You can put your shoes and socks back on. The waters, especially the flowing ones, are always borderlands, and when you cross them, sometimes it is not the same world, one side to the other. The streams will guide your feet to the correct shore, when you cross them.”

Sarah smiles, without fully understanding. “Thank you, mother.”

“I love you, my child. If you cannot find him, then find your way back home to me.”
