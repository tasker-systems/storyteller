# Now - A Haunt on the Rise

We walk together along the stream, the path a few feet above the gentle rush of the water, keeping close to its side. The sunlight no longer seems to break through the trees, and the wood seems still and close despite the movement of the water, as if that sound in its softness fills the available space. The earth rises sharply to the right, our path in a small ravine, the trees growing at sharp angles to the ground. Small rivulets run down the hillside from time to time, stones shaped smooth from the flow, now only in trickles as they wind down and meet the stream.

As we walk, though there is no sound or shadow to mark it, I have a sense of movement on the rise above us, a flickering between trees when my eye turns. I do not know who or what, or if perhaps only in my imagination so far from home and deep in woods that I do not know intimately. I have never been this many days walk into these woods, and these are not paths I know, perhaps there are animals or birds which move like little phantoms, natural surely but with a disquieting sense of alertness, awareness. As if being watched not by a hunter but by something which does not know if it wishes you to know of its presence, but not fully sure it wants to remain hidden, a mystery which would if pressed reveal itself. I cautiously look but only at moments where my head might turn naturally as I reach for a tree to steady myself, or in the midst of a stretch or sigh, or as if I only looked to my companion. At one such turn, the Wolf nods to me.

“Yes. There is a haunt, following.”

“Why?”

“We are trespassers, here.”

“Do they live?”

“Enough.”

“Are we resented?”

“Perhaps.”

“Should I call to them?”

“No. You cannot aid such as they are.”

“Do they desire aid?”

“They desire. It is all they are.”

I shake my head but not with understanding. We walk on, the haunt behind us, to the side of us, above us on the rise, following.

After some time we come to a small bridge, little more than a few stones stacked together, to cross the stream to the other side. The path does not continue further here. There are deer and rabbit trails that lead on up the hill, but the footpath we have walked continues only across the stream to the other side, across the bridge. I pick my steps with care but not slowly, and crossing soon find myself surrounded by mist, seeming to have come from nowhere. The Wolf is behind me and simply nudges past me, walking further forward a few paces. In a matter of moments it has become almost impossible to see more than a few footfalls ahead at a time. I rest my hand on his side and we walk, slightly staggered on the path.

The sound of the water grows louder, and the stream narrows and deepens, moving faster. The slope of the path begins to descend more sharply, and there is the sound of small falls rushing beside us, though through the mist I can see only fragments of water splashing. Across the water I can see almost nothing, though at moments I think perhaps I see the shape of a boy, his face turned toward us, watching, and suddenly moving.

The Wolf takes great steps down the newly angled decline and I cannot keep up, running as I can to keep my hand in his fur, to not lose sight in the mist, a sense of anxious concern coming over me to be lost in the density of this fog, though the path has not once forked or been difficult to follow. I rush behind him, leaping down the sharper grade, picking out the larger and more stable stones upon which to place my feet. The Wolf seems to bound almost without notice of any change to the path and leaps ahead. And as I scramble, the boy’s face seems to stop and look at us more frequently, as if trying to keep sight of us, too.

“Wolf!” I call out. “I cannot keep your pace!”

His great frame leaps once more and settles at the bottom of the path in a ravine. Through the mist I can see the dark of his shape, and I clamber down the rocks to find him. The mist seems almost not to touch him, or perhaps to merge with the silver-gray of his fur so completely that he draws it in, shimmering. I stop, catching my breath and my balance. I do not know if I am angry or frightened or simply winded, but together they make my voice louder than I intend in the fog.

“Do not fly from me. I do not know my way here.”

The Wolf does not respond but looks back across the stream, and then on ahead. He turns and pads forward, more slowly now, though without acknowledgement. After some minutes in silence, he turns his head to the side and sniffs at the rise across the stream, where it now disappears into trees, boulders, and mist.

“The haunt no longer follows.”

“Why?”

The Wolf huffs and the mist swirls about him, but he does not answer.

We walk through the mist for what must be the better part of an hour, or perhaps two. In the stillness I can count time only by footfalls and our breaths, and cannot truly tell. The sky is invisible through the gray, I cannot even see the tops of the trees or canopy. We have walked away from the stream and are walking deeper into the wood, though the ground to either side of the path is swampy and wet, and the mist does not clear. It is cold though, and the wet leads the chill in through my clothes, leaving me shivering despite our pace.

The Wolf seems confident of our direction. I have not seen branching paths, though I feel I could still become lost here, as if there is more than one way for the path to lead despite having no forks. It seems to move, inclined to mislead if it might, if attention wandered or intention flagged one could find themselves somewhere else entirely. Though perhaps it is only my disorientation in the mist, and fatigue of walking far, and quickly, in the damp and cold.

I have become lost in my thoughts, though they are occluded and indistinct, and it is not until we are upon it that I recognize a low stone fence, overgrown with moss but sturdy yet, and a small door set into a gap. The door is little taller than I am, and the wood looks soft, close perhaps to rotten, and is uncertainly held on the rusted hinges, with light passing through cracks between its planks. I pause to look at the door and the fence, and the Wolf slows ahead of me and looks back.

“I have seen nothing like this in these woods,” I say to him.

“It is not always here, when I have passed this way. It marks a boundary, and an invitation.”

“To us?”

“Yes.”

“You walked on, though? Would you not enter?”

The Wolf shakes his head. “Those beyond have their own ends, and theirs are not ours.”

“Who are they?”

“They followed before, or one did. Haunts, neither living nor dead.”

“Would they know of my brother, where he has gone?”

“Possibly.”

“Why would we not ask them, if this indeed is an invitation?”

“Nothing is freely given, here. And I have others I would prefer to owe a debt, than these.”

“Will your others know, for certain? Will they be near soon, and willing to answer?”

“I do not know.”

“Then I would enter this gate, and risk my own debts.”

The Wolf looks down the path, and the mist seems to swirl, as if it would move from his gaze. I can feel the path stretch out before us, calling him forward, though in my ears it feels silent, as if I am not requested, if not perhaps rejected. He takes a step forward and paws the ground, and sniffs the air. The trees whisper quietly in a small breeze, and his nostrils flare, his ears turning.

“We should continue on,” he says to me after a moment. “The path is impatient.”

I look and listen. “It is impatient for you. It does not know me, and does not care what I do.”

He turns his head abruptly, surprised, almost angry. “How? You are a mortal child. How could you know, even if you are wrong, and you are, how could you know it speaks at all?”

I shrug, not to pretend to indifference but because I do not know. “I can feel it pulling your steps, but it does not pull mine.”

He waits and looks at me. His eyes are dark and deep and the fur about his head and ears flickers like silver and fire in the mist. Finally he looks again down the path and then back at me. “It calls us both, but to me first because you are in my care.”

“I do not hear it. Perhaps you speak truly. But I would pass through this door, and meet who invites us in. A borderland of living and dying is where my brother may well reside.”

The Wolf looks at the door and gives a low huff and growl. But it is not a no. “Fine. But be wary of what is offered. Debts are incurred as easily as a Yes, and you may not know the cost until far later, and less willing to pay.”

I nod my head. I believe him, in this. I reach my hand to the door, and it is light on the hinges despite the rust. It creaks lightly but swings in gently, and though I do not have to stoop, I feel I should, as if perhaps in respect a bow made by lowering my head to pass, and so I do. The Wolf follows me through, forced to lower his head as well, though there is no semblance of a bow.

If I had expected a welcome, there is no sign or sound. The mist is thinner here, and I can see farther down the path, but along overgrown dirt roads between ruined houses and a crumbled chapel in the distance, the mist lingers, obscuring anything beyond. We are in a small village square, abandoned and not recently, old walls fallen down in piles of mossy bricks, piles of windblown leaves filling corners of structures with rotten and collapsed thatch roofs.
