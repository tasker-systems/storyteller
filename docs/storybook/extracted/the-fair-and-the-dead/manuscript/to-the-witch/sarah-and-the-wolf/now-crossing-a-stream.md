# Now - Crossing a Stream

The trees are too tall here. Looking up I cannot see their tops, dark pillars reaching up into a misted sky seemingly without end. The forest floor has found a path for us, though for a time it felt as if we must be lost. The Wolf would not answer when I asked, but only walked on, and in truth I did not want to turn back alone only to be lost so deep and far from any paths I know.

I am tired and want to sit here by the stream for a little longer. The flow is shallow enough here for us to cross without swimming, but when we arrived I insisted that we stop, drink, and rest. The Wolf never tires, but the Wolf does not walk as I do on mortal feet, and he does not sleep, nor need it. But I do, and last night though I lay curled against his fur and tried, fear and the newness of every sound was more than I could silence my mind against.

The Wolf speaks very little - I am not quite sure he ever speaks, but I hear a voice, and sound in my ears and not only in my thoughts. The voice of the Wolf is not terrible, and yet the syllables threaten a snarl such that if it began, I am afraid it would rend the air and trees and ground, and tear me bit from bit. Or I would be taken up by the snarl and as a symphony become part of a guttural growl that strips me of all I am and lets me float in a grand chaos of violent sound. More of me does not want that to happen than that of me which does.

“If we are not lost, then how much farther must we go?”

The Wolf looks into the distance between the trees, and makes a low sound. “Far.”

“Will there be food? Will there be a place to rest?”

“No.”

“I am tired, and I am hungry, and I will be cold when we rest again tonight.”

“Yes.”

“I want to help Tommy. Does our walking help us save him?”

The Wolf looks at me and for a moment I see his other face, or the night sky, or I think I do, but it slips from me and I cannot remember the shape of it, as if I was dreaming for a moment and between the blinking of my eyes woke. There is nothing I can read in his eyes, and he gives no answer. But he looks back into the distance, and sniffs the air, and the ground, and leaps across the stream in a bound.

“Come.”
