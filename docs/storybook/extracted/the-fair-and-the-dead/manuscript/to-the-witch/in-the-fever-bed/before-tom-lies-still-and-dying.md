# Before - Tom Lies Still and Dying

Sarah sits down next to her brother Tom’s sick bed, again, and takes his much larger hand in both of her own. She has already cried all the tears she has, and she just sits next to him, worn out from her own grief, from her mother’s and her father’s, from that of the preacher and the wise woman and the neighbors and Tom’s friends and hers, from the apologies of a doctor who could find no cause. She sits next to him and just rests her head against the sweat-stained sheet, feeling heat from the flushed skin of his forearm, holding his hand in hers.

Tom is dying. He can’t be made to drink, not really, not enough. And he won’t wake enough to eat, does not do more than turn once in a while in his sleep, a mutter or a ragged breath. An exclamation sometimes when the fever runs hot and he suffers. What he says doesn’t come out as words enough to make sense of, a half-heard name or a shout of No! She wants to find meaning in it but does not really believe there is any. The scrambled logic of fever dreams and exhaustion extending well into where he sleeps without resting, without recovery or peace.

“Would it be better if you woke?” Sarah muses mostly to herself. “Would you have any answers of what we can do? Or is it a mercy that you do not know you are lying here in misery, us in misery with you?”

She feels the discomforting mix of emotions that this question brings, as if there is a finality that she has not accepted and will not accept strung like twine between the words, waiting to be pulled tight, cinching up the edges and ending things once and for all. Would he be at peace if he died? Would she, or her mother, or father?

Sarah does not know how to think through the depths of this uncertainty. No one would be well equipped to do so perhaps, for their own flesh and blood, but Sarah is twelve and while she knows she is smart and strong, she can feel faintly at the edges of her thoughts the boundary beyond which she cannot see, the limits of her own thinking and experience. Sometimes the smartest thing you can do is know where you cannot see further on your own, so her mother says. She thinks, in this, her mother is right.

There are voices from the other room. The preacher is here again and, in his very polite way, is arguing with someone. Sarah cannot quite hear who, but she knows the sharpening tone of his soft-spoken voice as it rises and falls. Tommy’s dying has, perhaps unexpectedly, strained his faith. She did not know the preacher cared so much for her brother. Her parents, who have never been the most faithful of the preacher’s flock, have found themselves host to a well-meaning but unwanted source of comfort and encouragement in these already trying days. Sarah had heard that the preacher’s daughter had suffered some malady recently, and perhaps he is simply not able to bear it, and has turned his attention here to avoid his own more intimate tragedies.

Sarah places her brother’s hand back down gently on the bed, but he does not stir. She slides to the door to listen, less to eavesdrop than simply out of a kind of weary willingness to think about something else, even if that something else is someone arguing about Tommy. It is less, somehow, devastating than thinking of Tommy herself, without answer.

A low voice, she catches only the end of the sentence “…do not mean offense to you preacher.”

The preacher’s voice, still rising “It is not I who should be offended Adam, but these folks here, this poor boy’s parents and family, for such a suggestion.”

Her father’s voice murmurs, without much interest or conviction, “Adam, I was not offended. I thank you for your thoughts, I know you mean well, and aim to help us try anything we can to save our boy.”

The preacher all but interrupts. “John, nothing this man is saying will help your son! Why what he says can only bring further darkness of superstition and real calamity on your house, if you were to seek out such a solution to this sorriest of circumstances.” There is a pause, but only enough to draw breath. “Adam, I must ask you to go, and trouble these poor folks no further with such talk.”

The first voice, must be of one of the men from the village who she does not know, speaks in low tones again. “Preacher I do not mean harm. John, if I have caused you distress I withdraw my words, and say only that I wish you and your family a break from this sorrow, and the safe return of your boy.” There is a scrape of a chair on the floor and a set of footsteps retreating.

Her father’s voice. “I’ll walk you out, Adam,” and a second set of footsteps sound and then a door swings open. She cannot hear their voices as they continue. The preacher sighs and whispers something that Sarah cannot hear from here. Sarah does not know what Adam means by “the safe return of your boy” since Tommy is right here. It is a strange turn of phrase.
