# Before - Speaking with the Gate

Adam’s face shifts and moves. Sarah is not sure which is even his first face, now. Some moments it is subtle, a brow that seems to grow denser, darker, and then lightens again. Other times she would swear he is almost not a man, mouth pulling back away from teeth, or knuckles that bulge strangely. In this moment he is more a man again, but as if he wears two, three faces overlapping together, a countenance that is almost more unsettling than the changes that remind of beasts.

“It is strange to witness, I am sure, girl.”

Sarah realizes she has been staring, and he is smiling - more than one smile, an open easy grin and a sharp eyed smirk together - and she turns her face away, looking back to the low fire in the hearth. An iron kettle hangs over it, water for tea not yet boiling.

“I am sorry to stare. But yes. It is strange to me.”

“Does it frighten you?”

“Some. Yes.”

He nods, and chuckles, a voice rolling over another voice, heavier and raspy, lighter and carefree. “Me too, once.”

“How is it that you change? And did not when visiting my home today?”

“Concentration - focus can quiet them for a time. And they are less insistent, farther from the Wood.”

Sarah does not understand this, but she nods, considering. Adam does not offer more. He waits silently, reaching to tend the fire, then arranging tea in cups, waiting on the water to heat. The silence rests between them, and she is not sure if she would disturb it.

Finally the water sounds of boiling, and Adam picks up the kettle and pours, and they sit together, steam rising from cups. She looks at him again. His eyes and nose look as if they have narrowed, a hawk or other raptor looking out, sharp, intense. He tilts his head at her, and for a moment the uncanny of it slips or becomes comical, and she almost laughs, but catches herself, and blows across the tea instead.

“Why did you say Tommy was lost? He is at home, in bed, devoured by fever.”

“The fever is his body fighting to stay alive. Tommy is lost in a dream.”

“I do not understand.”

“You do.”

Sara reflects on this. She looks into her tea, and takes a sip, still too hot. She looks back at Adam, the sharp lines of a hawk now narrowing, a darker cast, as if a beak of all black, a crow with dark interrogating eyes looks out.

“Can he be found?”

“Yes. But I do not know if he will return.”

“He will. We are his family. We love him.”

Adam nods, but says nothing.

Sarah lowers her cup to her lap. “How can I find him?”

“You will need help. He is deep, deep into the dreaming Wood.”

“Have you seen him there?”

Adam shakes his head. “I have seen the fading glimmer of his vow, where it hangs gently in the memory of the path he chose. I have caught the scent of sorrow and resolve, dissipating. But it goes on deeper than I can see from this place.”

“How can I follow him? I do not know the deep Wood.”

“You have eyes to see, and paths will open to your step. But you will need a guide, a protector. There is much to be wary of, both by light and dark.”

His voice is low and serious. She is almost afraid to look at his face, but when she does, it is perhaps the most still, the most like the face he wore today at her home, that she has seen while being here. He looks at her, his eyes steady and for the moment, very human. “You will not be safe there. You may find him, and you may not. But you walk into the wilds beyond, if you follow him.”

She lifts her cup and drinks deeply, and sets it down on the table beside her. “Then Tommy is not safe either, and needs my help even more.”

He settles back in the chair and watches her. And the shape of whiskers, the long nose and bright ears of a fox seem to fold across his face and he tilts his head back and laughs in sharp, short barks. “Brave girl. Keep your spirit as strong as that, and you may return yet.”

She feels as if perhaps she should flush with self-consciousness, perhaps what the moment asks. But she does not feel that. She feels brave, and the words feel suitable, so she smiles back and laughs, instead.

Adam puts his hands on his knees and stands. “We must call you a guide. Come.”

He walks to the door she follows. He swings it open and steps out into the night. It is dark but not at all still, the air is humid and warm, and she hears the sound of running water in the distance, of insects singing, of frogs croaking, of the breeze in the leaves. Out here it is as if Adam’s shape no longer restrains itself, and his feet step as paws, hooves, shoes, toes, his posture shifting through crouches and loping steps and upright rolling gaits. He reaches out a hand to her that is rough and covered in fur, the nails long. His face is full of teeth again, his nose and mouth almost stretching to a snout.

He stops a few hundred yards into the trees, and it is so dark, and the trees grow thick and close - almost no moonlight gets through - only in small patches, and he pauses in one. He looks down at her and lets go of her hand, and he shakes himself and for a moment everything about him that was a man seems to drop away. His voice echoes from the dark.

“Do not be afraid. He will walk with you.”

In his place, a wolf, and the musk of it rolls over her and some part of her is terrified in an immediate and visceral way of this creature that is clearly no longer Adam wearing a face, but something else that has come through him. Adam, but no this creature, rounds to face her and his eyes are glowing, light like a thousand stars shining from deep black, and she begins to back away.

There is a roar, a growl, something that threatens to tear into her, and she sees Adam - the body of the man - fall down and lie still on the earth, but the shape of the Wolf comes toward her yet. This thing has passed through him beyond his face and is stepping on the earth with its own massive paws, leaving terrible heavy clawed footprints in the mud. The dense fur absorbs light yet still glows or shimmers, and its breath is real, heavy and thick, but parts of its bulk flicker transparent to the moonbeams and trees behind. She retreats, her heart racing, stepping back trying not to fall, not to turn away and run, knowing somehow she will be chased, caught, devoured. She walks backward, hand behind her, fingers reaching for the bark of a tree, the roughness of a boulder, something against which she can find stability, to stand firm and fast. Finally her fingers touch rough bark and she braces, standing still and looking deep into the infinite starry blackness of the creature’s eyes, the world-devouring shape of its jaws, the entropic madness of its face cut darker still against a pine-bough-blackened sky.

The Wolf looms large over her, and at its brow and above its head like fire dancing there are strange symbols she cannot understand, though they hold some rich meaning that she almost knows, and if she did suddenly remember or realize the fullness of them, she feels perhaps she would not be Sarah anymore. The symbols sear across her mind and she is beginning to go lightheaded, she grabs the tree behind and steadies, but begins to sag. The Wolf is the whole world, its eyes full of the night sky and its breathing the only sound she imagines ever hearing again. It leans its face in toward hers. Surveying, measuring.

Whether a growl or words she cannot tell. But she hears “Into the Wood.”

And then it is gone.
