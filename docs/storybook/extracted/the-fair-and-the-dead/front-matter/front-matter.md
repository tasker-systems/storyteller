# Front Matter

---

## Notes

Note that in the “Metadata” pane of the Inspector, under “Section Type”, the “Default Subdocument Type” is set to “Front Matter”. This setting causes all subdocuments of this folder to use the “Front Matter” section type by default (that is, when “Structure-Based” is selected as the section type).

This saves us from having to manually assign the “Front Matter” section type for each document we place into this folder.

During Compile, documents assigned the “Front Matter” section type will be laid out differently from documents in the main body of the manuscript.
