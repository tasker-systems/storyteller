# Charms and Prayers

Catch his breath back in a bottle

For the unborn twice-born child

Catches scent of it in the dying wind

And follows it back home

There are beasts

Monsters

In the woods, waiting, but not patiently and not for long

Twisted things of teeth and ghostlight in their eyes

Furious at being passed over
