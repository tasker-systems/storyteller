Principal conflict

Sarah wants her brother Tom to to come home, but Tom does not feel he can. He feels responsible for offering up his spirit to bring back a changeling that Beth can raise - better a changeling that leaves one day, than watching her die slowly of a grief she cannot bear. The changeling has already been pleaded into existence in the deep woods, beyond the pale light of dawn and beyond the evening twilight, in a place where moonrise only throws deeper shadows. The creature of blue light and haunting but not hateful eyes has already begun to crawl on tiny limbs out of unmapped space toward Beth’s empty cradle. Her tears are already drying when the sun rises tomorrow. Tom has already exhaled his freely-given last breath, to give life to the changeling child.

And so Sarah will find and catch his breath, and if she can catch his breath, she will bring the future back from its unfolding, she will catch up the past in its finality, and Tom will return to her. Or so she hopes upon uncertain hope. The Witch only said to catch his breath. She did not say more, and Sarah simply hopes.

The Queen of the Wood did not offer her a word of encouragement, nor did she stop her. She said the deal was struck and that is all. But what is made can be unmade, and Sarah will turn down the dark and winding path to the darker nights where the woods are deep and fae creatures slip in and out of real.

Violence

There are beasts who would stand in her way. Things passed over for a chance at life, creatures for whom the flicker of ghostlight is the only brightness. Who woke them and who set them in her path? Are they simply hungry, with no further malevolence, mouth and maw unsated? Or is there one who wakes them and sends them to find Sarah?

They would drag her down and bury her in the earth, forgotten, slowly decaying. Remorseless and full of violence.
