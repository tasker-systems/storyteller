# Refugees

Where did you flee from

How can ghosts be made refugees

What chased you from the hallowed graveyards

Of home

Was it the war

Does violence in the waking world

Scatter even the dead

Haunting these dreamed and forgotten places

What echoes travel with you

And what must be left behind

How do you make meaning in an unknown land

Are there no hearth fires that can be lit?

Can we create home here among the forsaken?

Do your gods hear you, can they travel far?

Sweep, churn, chop, cook, sing, plant, sew, hunt, hope

What little moments are left

To make life again

——

Beneath a church

Of a god who has traveled

To wherever dead gods go

To be worshiped by their believers

Once history has passed beyond

Catacombs with bodies no more than dust

And fragments of bone

New spirits dwell, in graves not their own

But do not rest

And not lying quietly is not the wrath of the wrongly dead

Nor the confusion of the disinterred

Nor even the aching mourning of the heartbroken from great loss

But is instead the hesitant uncertainty

Of those afraid they will be found out

Sent away

With nowhere else to go
