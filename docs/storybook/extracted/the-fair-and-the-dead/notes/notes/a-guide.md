# A Guide

Sarah needs a guide.

A spirit and beast sent by Adam to watch over. Anointed with glyphs and strange transforming sigils, eyes burning like starlight, with words that pour forth from a mouth and tongue that will not twist to the sound of the words of men.

He hides this face from her, but she is not a fool and she knows it is there, just out of sight.

Mostly he wears the shape of a wolf, larger than her twice over, shoulder standing to shoulder, head taller. The witch asks if she knows who she walks with, and Sarah does not answer.

Adam is a living Gate, and the wolf is a creature of power and renown in the Shadowed Wood, a dream of wolves and cold hungry winters and starlight that has woven itself out of memories of the forgotten dead, taking form and prowling.

We begin the story with Sarah and the Wolf crossing a stream.

“The voice of the wolf is not terrible, and yet the guttural rumble of syllables threatens a snarl at the back of it such that if it began, I am afraid it would rend the world.”
