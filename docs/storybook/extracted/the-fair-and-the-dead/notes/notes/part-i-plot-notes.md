# Part I Plot Notes

Sarah hears from Adam that her brother Tommy is lost. She does not know what this means, but the Preacher’s insistence that there is only superstition in his suggestions draws her interest. No one else has been able to help. Tommy’s fever only worsens and he is dying.

Sarah slips from her home quietly without speaking to her mother and father. Her mother is lost in her quiet not-quite-prayers and her father keeps finding chores that don’t really need to be done. She walks down the long road through the village, on past the marshes, and finds Adam in his small hut near the creek.

Adam is talking to himself-not-himself and the atmosphere is haunted. The spirits he traffics with are those of the dead, human and other than human. Shapes seem to writhe around his form and at times he looks like a bear, a fox, a toad, a young girl, a demon creature, and finally back to his face as an older man. He seems aware but unconcerned by the changes that have flitted over him. The spirits talk to him by becoming him, he does not have one fixed face unless he tries very hard. He tells her that his trip to her parents’ home was a struggle for him, he is not used to being away from his creek beds, and the easy flow of faces and voices. He does not try to hold still so much anymore, so few people come to see him now.

Adam tells Sarah of her brother’s whispered wish, but knows no more - he expects that her brother’s spirit is lost in the Shadowed Wood, an over or underlaid space between our world and the world of the dead and neverborn. Sarah presses him to show her a passage to the Shadowed Wood, but Adam is reticent - there is danger and it is not a place for a child. He tells her of another, a witch who lives at the borders, and suggests that she can perhaps help. He does not believe that Sarah will actually go find her, expecting instead that her fear will weaken her child’s resolve. He is wrong.

When Sarah leaves, he sends a spirit beast to watch over her, to follow her but to watch for Adam as well, if she should wander into the Shadowed Wood.

She returns home to pack and prepare. She does not have provisions, nor is she dressed, for a longer walk in the woods. Her mother stops her and seems to know what she intends, and she sings an enchantment over her, spells to invite the streams and creeks to friendship. She intones with a voice that seems beyond her mother’s common resonance, that the waters are always borderlands, boundaries between one world and the next. And that the streams and flowing rushing waters as she passes them over or through will ensure she finds her way to where her heart most guides.

Why doesn’t her mother try to stop her? She realizes with sudden clarity that her mother is not, precisely, a normal wife and home maker, and that her loyalties are different, less direct. What she had thought of as grief - which it is, also - in her mother’s affect is also a different kind of worry or concern, listening and conversing with the waters. Tommy’s fever is only part of her worries, but Sarah does not know how to say or ask more.

——

Tommy is dead, transforming, cannot go home. "There is not enough left of me, Sarah."

She goes on, to get his breath.

——

Can she make a life tending the fields of the neverborn? Where goes the Wolf?
