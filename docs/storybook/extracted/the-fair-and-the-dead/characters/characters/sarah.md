Sarah

12 • Lost in the Woods

Role in Story

Protagonist

Goal

Finding her brother, Tommy, and bringing him home

Physical Description

Short and wiry-thin, dark hair in two braids, but not long. She’d cut it off if her mother would allow it. Dark eyed with a purposeful set of chin and brow. Wears her brother’s old work pants and shirts, too large, amateurishly hemmed by her own hand. She wears heavy black shoes, thick soled and bought a few sizes too big to let her grow. She has grown, but not enough yet, and they still clump a little when she walks, but she shoves socks down in the toes to brace them. Often enough during long summer days she takes them off and carry them, her feet dirty but tough.

A face full of expressions that adults call sullen, but mostly just because she doesn’t smile deferentially by default. She knows it would be easy but can’t bring herself to do it.

Skin dotted with dark freckles from the sun.

Personality

Independent, but in manner of willingness to do what needs to be done, not needlessly argumentative. Strong willed and capable, but still just a child, so vulnerable and without the wisdom of experience. Courageous, and more afraid than she allows herself to recognize all the time.

Can be hard-nosed about life and adversity, but kind-hearted beneath a layer of pragmatism. Vulnerable though, loves her family and her brother, and has some sense of who she is, but within the limited emotional space of a pre-adolescent.

Occupation

Child. Capable with gardening and light farmstead and homestead work, confident in the woods but not trained for survival or dangerous situations.

Habits/Mannerisms

Clenches her fists without being completely aware of it.

Background

Early adolescent, has grown up rural, on a small farm.

Internal Conflicts

Afraid of being so young, of what she doesn’t know. Contrasts with how she understands herself in most situations, levelheaded and ready to take on difficulty.

She loves Tommy. He’s seventeen and to her seems so much older than she is. He loves her too, but he’s beginning to have his own life now, away from her and home. They still walk the woods together, but they don’t share as much anymore. Like Tommy’s got things he doesn’t know how to say, or doesn’t want to say. They still talked, but Tommy seems these days to find ways to not really share what he’s thinking, though he don’t rightly lie, either.

Sarah wants to be mad at him for it, knowing he’s pulling away and leaving distance that didn’t used to be between them. But really she just feels lonely, him smiling and answering with some joke or off-hand remark that sidesteps a real feeling, some truth he doesn’t reveal that feels like it must be so central to him now that it makes everything else he doesn’t say an echo of that central quiet. His eyes are sad more now than they had been once, but she doesn’t know why, and Tommy just laughs and denies it when she asks.

External Conflicts

Her brother Tommy has become a grown man, and they do not share the same bond anymore. He has become distant. She misses him, and falling ill, his spirit becoming lost, only makes this sense of absence and distance more acute.
