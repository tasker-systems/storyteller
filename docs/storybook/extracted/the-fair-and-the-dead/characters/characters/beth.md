Role in Story

Beth is Tom’s lover, the mother of their lost child. She is the daughter of the preacher, who knows of their affair and does not begrudge them - he loves Tom too and would welcome him as a son if they told him. All in good time, he believed, until the baby died, and the boy fell ill.

Beth is a kind young woman, wanting to start a family, in love with Tom and the idea of their life together. She is fragile though, and the loss of the baby sends her into a deep and unapproachable despair.

It is the preacher who begged Tom to find some way to reach her, and in a wild raving wished that even were it the devil’s work, to bring the baby back. When Tom falls ill, he fears there is something deeper at play, but cannot prove anything, and feels guilt for it.
