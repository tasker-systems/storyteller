# Adam

Adam

64 • The small village

Role in Story

The first one to raise in Sarah’s hearing that Tommy is “lost” - this sets her up to seek him out in the first place, where he spins her a tale of spirits lost and wandering. He is likely to come up again in Part III

Goal

Adam lives with the spirits, they speak with him constantly, closer to him even than friends. When Tommy gives his breath to give life to the changeling child, the spirits tell him that this has happened.

Adam holds alliance with the Ghostlight Queen, and she wants the neverborn child to come into the world. Adam sends the wolf with Sarah - to keep her safe, but to see that she fails.

Physical Description

Short and thin, with kind eyes. Smells of smoke all the time.

Personality

Keeping his own counsel. Kind, but with his own motives.

Occupation

Spirit-talker in a place where listening to the spirits is not welcomed. A talented silversmith.

Habits/Mannerisms

Background

Adam is a living Gate, where the dead pass, with whom he speaks, to whom he can give voice, and can enlist for aid.

The Ghostlight Queen holds power in the Shadowed Wood, and Adam is known and respected there, but it is not his home.

Internal Conflicts

He is a kind man and does not want Sarah hurt, but he has a loyalty to the Ghostlight Queen - and Tommy has already given his breath to bring from forgotten spaces the changeling child. Adam is not bound to service and could help Sarah, but Adam does not place such a fine distinction between living and dead, and Tommy’s sacrifice fits well into broader designs. Neverborn finding their way to the mortal world can open new paths, and Adam’s power grows when new paths wind to his Gate.
