Kate

40 • Farmstead Cabin

Role in Story

Sarah and Tommy’s mother.

Goal

To see her children grow up safely. To see Tommy recover. To tend to those who suffer, and to know the soft ways of the springs and creeks.

Physical Description

Brown hair with blonde-gold highlights, shoulder length and unbraided, but tied back. Lighter skinned than her husband and daughter, but sharing a complexion with Tommy.

Personality

Soft but not weak, just gentle and with a mind and heart to ease other’s woes and wounds. The kind of woman who prays, but not precisely to the God preached in Church, often found down by the spring when the weather is warm, feet in the water and singing-whispering prayers that she might not describe that way if anyone else asked.

She has no quarrel with the living-dying Lamb, but souls and salvation are the worries of another, sorrows and struggles enough right here, without need for eternal questions making murky where you could just help, today. Preacher comes by once in a while and they’ll all go to Church if he asks kindly enough, but she just smiles when he’s gone. “He’s a nice man, just don’t see as my soul needs much savin’ is all.”

Occupation

Home- and farmstead maker. Some minor skill with herbs. Good mother, good partner, and good friend. Not as tethered to the world as some, but not flighty, just seeing other patterns and other ways of being.

Habits/Mannerisms

Whispers ongoing prayer-songs to the springs and streams almost unconsciously.

Background

John teases her that she’s half naiad - he may be right. She was raised by an adoptive mother and father, and she knows that family is something you create, not just something you’re born into.

Internal Conflicts

She worries that she is not grounded enough for her duties as a mother, wife, home maker and farm worker. She finds herself drifting in thought, sometimes drifting in the water in fact, feet dangling into a creek or slipping into the swimming hole by the springs. She wants to be the kind of mother who knows what to do for her children and how to comfort them, but she does not always feel completely as if she is really “in” the world, and not able to navigate it so competently as her practical and resilient children.

She knows John loves her devotedly and without question, and she loves him too, fully, though with a not-entirely-conscious distance, as he does not really see or understand the things that matter most to her. Not because he does not want to, but because he has the strong-backed practical perspective, and doesn’t understand, but does not judge or dismiss, her more ethereal flights of inspiration.
