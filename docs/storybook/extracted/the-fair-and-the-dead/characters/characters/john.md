John

38 • Farmyard

Role in Story

Sarah and Tommy’s father.

Goal

To protect his children, and see them safe. To build a life. To be as good a man as he knows how.

Physical Description

Shorter and wider than Janet, darker skinned and darker hair. Sarah gets her jaw and brow from her father. Rough hands from work, but fingers nimble enough to play songs on the old beaten lute when work is done.

Personality

John didn’t pray much before Tommy got sick, and he seemed to not have an easy time of making it a habit. He tried, going slowly to his knees by his boy’s sick bed, but his whispered words held only need, no eloquence or incidental grace. Maybe, he hoped, the Preacher’s God didn’t judge that way.
