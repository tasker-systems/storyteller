Background

Unbeknownst to his family, Tommy has a lover, Beth, and they had a child. The child was stillborn, and Beth was heartbroken, as was he. The Fair Folk came and said they could take the child, and whisper a strange kind of life to it, one that would not thrive in human lands, but could allow the child to live as a Fair One, if not grow old and die as human, in the Other Land. Rather than see their child simply perish, they said yes, and the Fair Folk took the limp thing wrapped in blankets away with them.

This would have been the end of it. But Beth’s heart would not mend. Her loss was too great for her to bear, and she could not rise from the bed, day after day, week after week. She would die of heartbreak, Tommy feared. And rather than live without her, he chose to send his spirit after the Fair Folk.

Going to the Witch of the Wood, he begged of her some way to send him to the Other Land. She tried to dissuade him of it, knowing that if he was successful in the ways he hoped, he would not return home. But he would not listen, and she relented. For perhaps he was right, would it be worse for Tommy to give his life for his child, than for Beth to die of heartbreak? Impossible questions to ask and answer, and so she found roots and mushrooms and leaves and stems, and she crushed them down and boiled them. And she told him that his body would fever, and his spirit would wander, and if he was brave and strong and determined, he could perhaps find his child, and find a way to bring them home.
