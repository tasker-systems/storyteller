Epistle Sixteen, Fire.

To burn - you will look upon it and believe you have known this before, that this is as it always has been, from the beginning.

There are no truths that were not first lies.  When you find my word false, remember.

Did not the wind portend?  And as it like a billows blows across these embers, again will the flame leap up, and show you such strange things.

The fire was before and after even her, and she is, like we are, of it, and in.  If there is before or after it I do not know, but that it burns.  Are our thoughts more than this?  Might the earth bring forth life from other than the soil, or the surf crash upon the shore as other than a wave?  That they are answers all they will of this, all perhaps there is of this to know.  That you might pass into such mystery is all my hope; without it there is nothing.  For though she has abandoned me as often as returned, in this we are ever one, and two.  Should you sup upon her body and her blood, it will be as birth and death to you, but for such communion she has not died.  Like you of fire, she waits upon us, the stars, and tempest winds to be born.

-----

Isabella half-carried me inside.  I was incoherent.  In broken words I told her Mallory was dead, stumbling through trying to communicate that I remembered she had been all along.  She let me cry and she held my head against her shoulder, her breast, and like a child I wept for a long time.  Too long to even feel foolish or embarrassed by the time I stopped.  Just tired, my face swollen.  I stood up, went to the sink for some water.  I saw myself in the mirror, in the over-white buzzing light I felt like I was false, an apparition, something that had only chanced to be at all from some spot of memory and flicker of accidental luminescence.

It was after midnight.  Isabella looked tired, though she was trying not to show it.  I drank the last of the water in the cup and walked back, put my hand on her shoulder, standing behind her.  She leaned her head back against me, touched my hand with hers.

I spoke quietly.  “You don’t have to stay here with me tonight.  You’ve got to be tired, putting up with me… with all of this.”

She rocked her head back and forth, still resting it against me.  “I don’t mind.”

“Thank you.”

She looked back up at me.  “Don’t be silly.”  She turned her face and kissed my hand then stood up.  “I can stay, you can come to my place, whatever would be better for you.”

Our fingers were interlocked, hanging between us.  “I don’t know.  I think maybe I should be alone for a while, try to think.”

“That’s not a good idea.”

“I know.  But I’ll be alright.”

“Will you?”

I nodded.  “Yeah.”

She stood silently for a moment, then gave a small resigned nod.  “You can call me any time tonight.  I’ll come back, or you can come over.”

I squeezed her fingers in mine gently.  “Thank you.  For everything.”

The smile on her face was pained.  As if she noticed me noticing, she shook her head.  “It’s Ok.  You don’t need to thank me.”

“I do.”

“You don’t.”  She hesitated, and then slipped an arm around me and hugged me.  “Call me tomorrow, either way, Ok?”

I nodded.  “I will.”

“Alright.”

She walked out the door, but turned back.  She took my hand again.  “Remember for me.  Remember that no matter what else, tonight was very real.  That I was real, with you.”

I looked at her strangely, but she just shook her head and kissed me on the cheek, and left.

I tried to think.  I sat on the edge of the bed and I went over it in my mind, how this had come about.  Both series of events.

I remembered walking into the room, her little apartment back home, the cheap one that we could afford with her disability checks.  She hadn’t returned my calls in a few days.  I knocked at her door but there was no answer, I used my spare key to get in.  There was no one in the living room, no sound.  The TV was off, no radio or music.  Just silence.  There was something wrong with the air, a smell I knew all the way at my brainstem.  I called to her, but she didn’t answer.  I walked to her room, and I saw her.  There was a loop of wire around her neck and she was hung from the ceiling, her face black, her tongue swollen out over her lips.  Blood down her neck from where it had cut into her with the pressure.  A streak of something dark down her leg, sticking to her nightgown, staining the carpet beneath her.  I had a strange thought of how they wouldn’t just be able cut that section up, they’d have to replace the whole carpet in the bedroom probably.  It was surreal.  She wasn’t there, it was a dummy or a prop, hung too perfectly still.

I walked beside her and I looked at her nightstand beside the bed.  Medication bottles and her diary, both sitting on top of the journals she had borrowed.  A few post-it notes stuck in the journals, just like the ones I had in the car now.  The same notes.  I sat down on her bed, picked up her diary and paged through it, not really reading anything.  I turned on my side and put my head on her pillow, and I lay there staring out beyond her dangling legs and feet.  Looked into the beige carpeted hallway, the walls dirty, scuff marks and bumps and nicks of people moving in and out, never repainted.  An electrical socket without a plate, cracked drywall around the hole.  And I realized this was death, just like it had been life.  Forgettable.  Gone, in an apartment that would be re-rented, a life without the need of place, vanished, the little cracks in the bathroom vanity now someone else’s intimate detail, the dignity of chipped laminated counters taken away.  A life robbed of its mindless footnotes, no longer filling the sparsely furnished space.  Forgotten and already brushed aside.

But her getting in the car with me, that was real too.  The sound her foot would make tapping against the door while we’d drive, in time with some music she heard in her head, or radio stations she flipped through.  Ordering breakfast, and both of us deciding who got what bed at night, who got the shower first and who would make the coffee.  Her folding and unfolding the map over and over while I was driving, and that it annoyed me that she did it.  The tedium and the aggravations and the laughter and the noise, those were real.

I was tired, sitting and staring on the edge of the hotel bed, and though I did not want to, I fell asleep.

I woke up late.  A knock at the door from the maid was all that finally got me up.  I took a shower and shaved, trying to clean some of the night off my skin, out of my head.  If it worked I couldn’t tell a difference.  I called Isabella but she was with a customer, asked if she could call me back.  I got changed, went to the front desk and tried my best to keep my face impassive while telling them they could stop looking out for someone by my sister’s description.  Telling them she’d been found.  The desk clerk and manager were polite, said they were glad to hear things had worked out.  I nodded, said I was too.

Breakfast had been closed and cleaned up from the little dining room hours ago; one of the attendants was nice enough to give me a bagel and some coffee anyway.  I walked back to my room but felt like I couldn’t stay still, decided to take a walk around back of the hotel.  Beyond a chain-link fence were just trees, foliage pressed up against and growing through the links, aluminum signs, warning of trespass and no parking, corroded and fading.  There was a gap in the fence, part of it missing like it had been hit by a car, and I was able to walk through it.  Bagel and coffee still in hand I walked through the fence in the back, and into the small wood behind the hotel.

I could hear traffic from beyond where I could see, and the little grove seemed small with a parking lot and a road so nearby.  It was pleasant though, a kind of silence despite the noise, unexpected.  I walked, the occasional stillness broken further by my footfalls on pine needles, the crunch of pine cones beneath the soles of my shoes.  I walked and I listened, as if thinking perhaps here in a spot of living things between the swathes of asphalt that the splitting of memories might make sense.  To understand how it was that I had so clearly imagined Mallory’s presence with me.  The why was perhaps the easiest of the questions I could ask, answered in sad tones of repression or simple disconnect.  But how, more than a question of psychological mechanism, was it that I had so fully and clearly convinced myself of her presence, her discourse, her opinions and her laughter?  I didn’t know and it made no better sense between the trunks of trees echoing the passing of invisible cars.  The road out there like these memories, an unwitnessed space beyond, evident only by sound and inference.

My phone rang, it was Isabella.

“Hi, I’m sorry I couldn’t talk just then.  Customer was interested in having me order some pieces.”

“No problem.”

“Did you want to come by?”

“I don’t want to interrupt.  I don’t need anything really, I guess I just don’t have anywhere else to be.  Mostly wanted to say thank you again for last night.”

“You’re welcome.  Why don’t you come over, we’ll go get lunch.”

“You sure?  I know it’s a little late.”

“I haven’t gotten around to eating yet, anyway.”

“Alright.  Want me to meet you at your place?”

“That’s fine.  I’ll see you then.”

I hung up but didn’t move immediately.  I walked to the trunk of a large tree and leaned against it, feeling drained, wanting for a few more minutes to have no responsibility but to listen to the sound of cars, to see the sway of the treetops in a breeze I couldn’t feel.  To be hidden and secreted away in this tiny patch of trees, a place that was nothing but between other places, and for it unknown, nameless.  It felt for an instant as if sacred, the holiness of that which has slipped so utterly from the commonality of shared space as to seem no more than accident.

I met her at the shop.  We decided on a little sandwich place she knew, and drove to it together.  We didn’t talk much on the ride; she seemed still preoccupied, I assumed it was with work.  My mind was all but silent, like my ears were still ringing too loud from last night, no real thought penetrating.  She didn’t seem to mind the quiet, and I was grateful for it.  I didn’t want to be alone, but didn’t want to engage, either.  The silence was comfortable, at least for me.

She pulled into a space and parked, shutting off the car.  She twisted the keys from the ignition, but kept them in her hand, letting it fall to her lap.  She turned to look at me, a strange expression on her face.

“I’m sorry about Mallory.”

“Yeah.  Not your fault.”

She paused, then shook her head.  “No.  I wish I could help, though.”

“You helped last night more than I could have asked.”

She reached over and touched my hand, and smiled at me.  “Guess we should go in.”

“Probably so, yeah.”

We went in, ordered, and picked a table off to the side.  Next to a window, though the only view was of the parking lot.  I sat quietly, still not really present, though she didn’t seem like she was either.  Eventually she looked over at me and smiled again.

“I’m sorry, I’m just a little tired.  I’m not trying to be poor company.”

I smiled.  “I was thinking the same thing about me.”

“How’d you sleep?”

“Hard.  I don’t know that I’m that rested, but I slept like I was dead.”

“Makes sense.”

“Yeah.  I’m sorry I kept you so late, though.”

“I wanted to be there.”

I was quiet for a minute.  I was tired, I spoke without thinking.  “Why?”

“What?”

“Why did you want to be there?  You were being really nice to me, so I don’t mean to sound ungrateful.  I just wondered why.”

“I saw someone in pain.  I wanted to help.”

“Do you help everyone you see that needs it?”

Her face darkened a little, and she grew quiet.  I realized what I must have sounded like.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that to be rude.”

“It’s Ok.  And no, I don’t help everyone.”

I nodded, waiting.  She seemed like she was considering.

“I need to tell you something.  I wasn’t sure how to say it before.  I don’t know that I am now, either, but I don’t know what else to do.”

“Ok.”

“I was told to be watching for you.  When you showed up outside my shop, I already had an idea of who you were.”

“What?”

“I got a call a few weeks ago.  They didn’t say who they were, or what it was about.  They just told me your name, described you, and said you’d be here in a few weeks time.  They said you’d need a friend, and that it would be better for me if I helped you.”

“Who called you?”

“I don’t know.  Honestly, the whole thing frightened me.  The voice was strange.  Unsettling.  And they knew things about me, about my life.  They didn’t exactly threaten me, but I didn’t feel like I was being asked, either.”  She paused for a moment.  “And they paid me.”

“They paid you to… what?  To be my friend?  To try to seduce me?”

“No… no, it wasn’t like that.”

“Then you tell me how it was.”

My voice was louder than I had realized.  The waitress brought over our sandwiches, looking at me sternly, obviously indicating that yelling in here would get me kicked out.  I took the plate and mumbled an apology.  When the waitress left, I repeated, more quietly.  “So, explain it to me.”

“I asked you to remember.  That it was really me with you there last night.”

“Yeah, you did.  I don’t really know what to do with that right now.”

She nodded.  Neither of us ate.  She was quiet for a few minutes, then spoke.

“I was attracted to you.  You were vulnerable and I… I shouldn’t have taken advantage of that.  But that was me, it didn’t have anything to do with them.”

“What did they tell you?  What were you supposed to do?”

She shrugged.  “I don’t really know.  The voice on the phone just said to be there for you when you arrived, that you would need someone.  They said I would be contacted, that it would be up to me to convince you of something when they decided it was time.”

“To point me deeper into this mess?”

“Probably.  I don’t know.”

“So, when I told you about what Mallory and I had seen… what I had seen on this trip, you already had some idea of who was behind it.”

She shook her head.  “I just heard a voice on the other end of the phone.  Your story made me think it was probably connected, but I didn’t know how.  I still don’t.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Because they said it could be bad for me if I told you they’d spoken to me.  That you weren’t supposed to know.”

“What difference would it make?”

“I don’t know.  I really don’t.  I’m sorry.”

“Then why are you telling me now?”

She looked down at her plate, her voice quiet.  “I guess… I feel guilty now.  I didn’t know you before.”

I picked up my sandwich and took a bite.  My mouth was dry, the bread tasted like sand.  I chewed it and swallowed anyway, and another.  I didn’t know what to say.  She picked up her sandwich and ate with me, both of us in silence.  Even my anger was dissolving into weariness, into the same sense of unreality that had clung to me since I’d woken up.  I didn’t know if she was just being used by them, or if she was a conspirator as well.  I didn’t know and couldn’t think of a way to tell.  I began to think it didn’t matter.  That she was right in her way, that she’d been with me when I needed someone to be, for whatever reasons.  I hadn’t been betrayed, we were no more than strangers.  There was no bond to be broken, and lies served as well as the truth when I was crying on her shoulder.

Finally I looked up, putting the remaining crust down on the plate.  “It’s Ok.”

“What?”

“That you lied about it, or concealed it, or whatever.  You don’t know me, you didn’t owe me anything.  And you were kind to me last night.  Maybe you’re still lying, I don’t know.  I don’t really care, now.  I’m going to go home, try to sort some of this out.  I guess I’m saying thanks for helping me last night, whatever the reason was.”

She nodded, her eyes down.  “Thank you.”

The waitress brought the check, we each put in cash to cover the total and the tip.  We stood up to leave and walked out the front door.  There was a small patio with a few tables and chairs, but no one sitting in them.  She stopped, walked a few steps toward it.  I didn’t follow, but she motioned me over.

“Before you go… I wanted to ask you something.”

“Ask what?”

“On your trip, the things you described.  Some of the… well, things that didn’t seem natural.  The prophesying, the strange knocks.”

“Yeah.”

“What if I said I believed you?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know.  What difference would it make?”

“Maybe none.”  She paused.  She started to say something, but stopped herself, and looked back at me.

“What is it?”

“It’s just that…  I know a few things about ghosts.”

I laughed.  “Do you?  Like what?”

“Like how to call them.  And how to talk to them.”

“That’s… great.”

She shook her head.  “I’m serious.  What if you didn’t imagine your sister being with you all those days on the road?”

“What?”

“What if she wasn’t in your head?  What if she was really there, just maybe not the same as you’d think?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“I think you do.  I think you’ve started wondering about it yourself.”

“So, what are you saying?  Mallory was a ghost?  And you can talk to her?”

“I didn’t say I could.  But I know how to try.”

“Like what, a seance or something?  You’re a psychic?”

“No, not quite like that.”

I didn’t answer immediately.  I looked out across the parking lot, realizing my car wasn’t there, that it was back at her shop still.  I had a drive across over half the country waiting ahead of me.  I looked at her and sighed, running my hand over my eyes.  “Look, I need to get on the road.  There’s nothing left for me to do here.  You believe you’re a medium or whatever?  That’s great.  You have a table tapping session all on your own.  You see Mallory, you say hi for me, Ok?  But I need to leave.  I’m obviously crazy enough without holding hands in the dark to make my dead sister talk to me any more than she already has.”

She nodded.  “Ok.  There’s just one other thing you should see.”

She reached into her purse and pulled out a photograph.  It was me, sitting in my car in front of her shop.  And next to me was Mallory, wearing sunglasses and looking out the window like she was bored.  I stared at it without blinking.  I didn’t know what to say.  I handed it back to her.  “It’s obviously a fake.  Why show me this?”

She shook her head.  “How would it be a fake?  I’d never met you before yesterday.  I didn’t know who you were or what your sister looked like.  I took a photograph of you before I knocked on your window, just in case I couldn’t convince you to come in.  Just to have proof I tried, in case someone came looking for me to find out why I didn’t help you.  I didn’t see your sister there when I took the picture.  Not until I pulled the photos off the camera this morning did I see it, on my computer, clear as day.”

I took the photograph back from her without asking and looked at it again.  The shadows seemed right.  The angle of the sun reflecting off her glasses matched the windshield.  It was a good fake.  As good as the ones I’d been sent with the journals.  It must have been prepared for her while I was asleep last night, likely by the same people.

“You’re working with them, then.  This is a fake they gave you, and you’re working with them in all of this.”

“I’m not.”

“I don’t believe you.  That photograph is bullshit and you know it.”

“You need to try to trust me.”

“Why?  What possible reason would I have to do that?”

“Because I’m telling you the truth.  I can help you, if you want to see your sister again.”

“Whatever you’re doing right here is either cruel or misguided.  I can’t tell either way, but honestly, I don’t care.”

She looked at me, her face downturned.  Her voice came muted.  “What if I am working with them?  I’m not, but what if I was?  Would it hurt to let me try?  What’s the worst that could happen?”

“I don’t know that I’m interested in what the worst thing could be.  I’m more interested in just not being involved anymore.”

“Just… let me drive you back.  Come inside with me for a few minutes.  It won’t take long.”

I sighed, looking over at her car.  I paused for a moment.  “Let’s say I decide to go with you.  What would we do?  Light some candles, chant to the spirits or something?”

“Something, yes.”

I took a long breath.  I was tired, too tired to fight about it.  The worst that could happen was nothing, and that would happen whether I went with her or not.  Thirty minutes of nonsense and I could just get in my car and leave.  “Fine.  I need a ride back to my car anyway.  Let’s just make it fast.”

“Really?”

“Whatever, yeah.  Let’s just go.”

We drove back, the drive seemed shorter on the return.  She unlocked the store and let us in, locked it again behind us.

“I have a few things I’ll need to do to get ready.  Do you mind waiting down here?”

“No.  About how long do you think this will take?”

“You never can tell for sure.  I don’t think it will take long.”

“Depends on the ‘spirits’ behaving?”

“Something like that.”

I laughed in spite of myself, and she smiled.  She didn’t seem to mind my obvious disbelief.  She walked upstairs, I waited around down below, looking at the pieces of glass.  They were, in any event, still pretty.  I wandered about the store, looking without any specific intent, picking up pieces I had earlier been too anxious over dropping to investigate.  I found one that caught my eye, a little bell-shaped flower hanging at an angle, it’s five-pointed blossom white at the tips, growing darker toward purple near the base.  It was beautiful and delicate, and looked somehow dangerous, between seductive and threatening.  I found myself caught staring at it unmoving, watching the light play over it.

“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”

I looked up, Isabella was standing at the base of the stairs.  “It is.  What kind of flower is it supposed to be?”

“A datura of some sort, I believe.  Relative of the Angel’s Trumpet.  Would you like it?”

“No, that’s fine.  I was just looking.”

“You should take it.  Consider it a small gesture of apology.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes.  It would make me happy for you to have it.”

She walked from the stairs and over to me, picking it up.  It looked right in her hands, a kind of threat emanating from both, attractive, a poisoned flirtation.  She walked the flower back around behind the desk and pulled out some tissue paper and a small box, and wrapped it.  She handed it to me.  “There.”

“Thank you.”

“I’m glad you like it.”  She took a breath, and looked back toward the stairs.  “Are you ready for us to start?”

I looked outside, the afternoon light still gold but dimming.  “Do we need to wait until it’s dark?”

She shrugged.  “That works best, yes.  But you said you wanted to leave, I didn’t want to keep you waiting.”

I looked around.  I didn’t really want to get back on the road yet.  I wanted to sit down.  In all honesty, I wanted to go back to sleep.  The more quickly I headed home, the more quickly the rest of it became real.  For all my bluster before, I didn’t really want to have to be alone in the car, driving home.  Even knowing she was lying to me, she was better company than none right now.  “Why don’t we wait, then?  If we’re going to do it, we may as well do it right.”

“That would be great.”

She walked past me and headed upstairs, motioned for me to follow.  I did, my boxed flower in tow.

She talked and I listened, albeit absently.  She talked about ghosts and their history in the occult.  She described necromancy and magick circles, how one could coerce the dead to manifest, and if propitiated, speak.  She talked about the witch of Endor, and the raising of the spirit of Samuel.  She described Odysseus and Teiresias, and the methods of Greek necromancy, the shades and pits opened to Hades.  Blood and a sword, and other things I didn’t understand, didn’t really know what to make of.  I was only half listening.

She poured wine.  I first declined, then accepted.  I was already tired, and should this take very long at all once it got dark, I would be no good to drive tonight anyway.  I relaxed and had a drink.  Eventually I noticed that it in fact had grown dark, and Isabella was standing up from the couch.

“We should get started.”

I nodded, and set down my glass.  She picked it back up and handed it to me.  “You should finish it.  It’ll help you relax.”

“Doesn’t this sort of thing need concentration?”

“Only for me.  If you’re too tense you won’t see anything.”

I shrugged and drank the rest.  She led me to a room in the back, turning off the other lights in the house.  I stood mostly in the dark while she walked around the little room, lighting candles one by one.  She waved out the last match, and looked back to where I was standing.

“Come in, close the door behind you.”

I did, but didn’t step much into the room.  I could see on the floor a chalk outline of a circle, words in what looked like Hebrew written around the edges.  There was a triangle on the ground before it, and in the triangle was a round black mirror.  About the triangle were three words, and about the circle of the mirror was ringed a fourth.  She walked over to me and took my hand and pulled me closer.  I hesitated.

“What is all of this?”

“Don’t worry, you don’t have to do anything.  This is for me.”

“But what is it?”

“A kind of magick circle.  It works for this kind of thing.”

“What kind of thing is that, exactly?”

“Calling your sister.”

I began to feel uneasy.  “I’m not sure I want to be involved in this.”

“I thought you didn’t believe me?”  I didn’t answer.  She smiled and laughed at me a little.  “Don’t worry so much.  You’ll be fine.  All you have to do is sit, and watch.”

There were at four corners a stick, a cup, a knife, and some coins.  She pulled me between them and had me sit down with my legs crossed in the circle.  She walked behind me.

“I’m going to change.”

My head was beginning to spin with the wine.  I was relaxed but not calm.  The whole scenario was unnerving, I had expected maybe some candles, a table we would sit at.  A crystal ball, even.  This was not what I had in mind.  Whatever was about to happen here, she believed in it.  More than just groaning out to spirits at a seance.  I would have traded this for that, now.  I didn’t feel like I could stand.

“The wine’s strong.”  I had an alarming thought.  “Did you put something in it?”

She laughed.  I turned around and she was partially naked, in the candlelight I could make out the shape of her leg, the curve of her hip.  She slipped a black robe all the way down over her, and turned back to face me.  “Just a little, to help you see.”

My head was spinning faster now, even having my head turned to see her was a great deal of effort.  “What did you do?”

“Relax, Chris.  You’ll be Ok.”

I couldn’t speak, couldn’t focus my thoughts enough to gather a response.  My head almost of its own accord turned back.  She had placed me such that my eyes naturally descended into the round black mirror on the floor, the one in the triangle.  I had no sense of sleeping, only of being very strangely intoxicated, unable to move, to think clearly or normally.

“Good, look just there.  I’m sorry for not warning you.  You haven’t spent time learning to do this, and we don’t have enough to prepare you.  You wanted to see your sister.  That can be made to happen, though perhaps in a way you wouldn’t otherwise have accepted.”

I struggled to make my mind move, to make my mouth whisper.  “Was this… was this something they told you to do?”

“No.  Not the voice on the phone.”  She took a gleaming sword from a case against the wall, and she stepped into the circle.  “Now.  Be quiet.  Once I begin you mustn’t interrupt me.  And don’t, for any reason, leave the circle.”

I tried to speak but found I was less and less able to form words.  Sounds came from my lips but nothing more, and soon I stopped trying.  I gazed into the black mirror and I waited, too drugged even to be angry, only frightened and unsure what was to occur.

She began to speak in a clear voice.  Some of it was in English, other parts in Latin.  Still more was in a tongue I didn’t recognize.  She said prayers to a God I suspected she only part believed in, and abjured unclean things by angelic names even I could recognize.  Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael.  She called out to the space between the candlelight by names sounding holy even if I did not know them, which she vibrated in a strong, strange voice.  I was afraid, though whether of spirits or the woman who had drugged me and sat me in the center of a room filled with fire and steel, I couldn’t feel certain.  I was afraid of both.  I wondered if my fear was part of this.

I blinked my eyes.  I closed them fully and reopened them, focusing on the black mirror.  Something had moved.  I looked away and looked back, to be certain.  Something in the depths of it was moving.  It was as a swirling mass, a cloud perhaps, or a fog.  It seemed to rush and flicker like static from a television set flipped to empty air.  Isabella was turning toward different corners, but she rounded and stopped, facing the mirror.  I did not look to see if she stared into it as well.  But she spoke toward it, and she began to call to my sister.  Mallory, she said, sister of the brother who waits.  She called into the mirror, her voice stern, intense, unwavering.  She did not call as if she had any doubt.  She commanded again by new holy names, calling forth an appearance.

And then she was there.  Mallory, in the depths of the mirror.  The clouds swirled but seemed to slow, and if they did not pass then they receded that I could not see them.  She looked out through the mirror at me, but she did not smile or speak.  I could see two of her at once, her dead face still blackened and swollen, and her living one thin and pale.  They did not change one to the other but instead I could see both in the selfsame space.  She looked out at me with level eyes.  I do not know if Isabella saw her then, though I did.  My eyes stopped blinking.  Already drugged I fell into a trance, and as if I descended into the vision I felt the whole of me sliding into the mirror.

Into Mallory’s hand a book appeared, and she did not look away from me but she opened it, and began to speak, as if reading.  As her mouth moved, my own voice spoke.

“And there will be twelve lights, and twelve signs, and twelve histories all bound together.  And there will be a woman and there will be a child, but the child will forget her.  Brother, into a dark place you will descend, but you will not find me.  I have been gone for longer than you know, but do not fear.  She is here with me.  But the old woman waits and of her you must be ever wary, vigilant though her lies be truths.”

I spoke her words and I saw before me a dark cave, and in it I saw myself.  I saw a plant in the center of the room, and I was kneeling down before it.  There was a young and beautiful woman, almost glowing and translucent, standing behind me, but my mirror self did not see her.  She was watching me as I knelt, but she turned and looked at me through the mirror, and she smiled.

There was a young girl lying on the ground, and beneath her, blood.  There was an old woman crying before her, holding a boy child clasped in her arms, close.  She wept and the boy did not move, and the girl was not breathing.  This was not the same cave.

But then again it was and Mallory was there before me and she spoke again, and through her words but from my lips came sound.

“We repeat, our roles only vary.  The goddess waits, but only for us.  She is coming.  She is coming.”

And then from the dark below a spirit rose up, the pale woman as before, beautiful, her eyes full of distant stars, and I loved her instantly, withholding nothing.  She knew me, and she looked down as she rose, but did not call to me, not yet.  I knew it was not to be my time until some distant day.  But as if a mercy she took my hand and lifted me, and with her I ascended into a golden place, where as if like jeweled strands a thousand thousand lines of light spread out, a wide and ever reaching web, the net of Indra, I heard whispering.  And she with her delicate step lit atop it, running or dancing I could not tell, and I was carried like a ribbon behind, flailing in the wind.  She laughed and she stopped and she was still, and she pointed down and I looked below.  I could see the earth, swarming with like lines of gold, twisting and wrapping and writhing.  Down further and I could see each man and woman and child shimmering in the light of it, coiled about and becoming them, arising from them, a pulsing diamond heart of each.  And from them to all else, and from all else to them, tree and mountain and river and home and highway and telephone line and skyscraper and computer screen and book cover.  I could see thought as if it were energy and it was streaming in brilliant cascading rivers through the whole of the world.  And I looked upon her and I saw her transformed and she was this and it was her, and in that moment I knew her and I saw.  I saw everything.

And then I fell, though slowly.  I fell down, and I passed back out through the mirror until I felt myself in my body, still drugged and unable but to scarcely move, and not to rise.  Isabella was calling out loudly, as if struggling, trying to close the vision, to bring me back in, to stop it.  I twisted to my side and I vomited.  She did not look down, but continued to call out to the empty air, until the vibration of everything about me seemed finally to slow.  As it did I heaved again, but didn’t throw up.  I lay still on my side, my head on my arm.  She traced symbols into the air with the sword, the candlelight made it glitter and gleam.  Finally she seemed to feel it was closed and safe, and she looked down at me.

“Are you Ok?”

I tried to nod.  My head lolled on my arm.  She knelt down and touched my shoulder.

“Don’t move, I’ll get something to clean you up.”

She did, lifting me, wiping my mouth with a cloth.  Movement came back into my arms and legs, though slowly.  I stood the best I could, and stumbled with her arm in arm back out to the couch in the living room.  She set me down.

“I’ll be back.”

She turned a lamp on, and went back into the side room.  I saw candlelight flicker out, and she re-emerged, changed from the robe back into her other clothes.  She went to the kitchen and I heard the faucet turn on, she returned with a glass of water.  She held it out to me, I took it with both hands, carefully, and drank.  My stomach was fine now, I didn’t feel as if I might be sick again.  But my head was still clouded and strange, and speaking came hard.  I concentrated.

“What…  was that.”

I looked at her, and she seemed shaken.  Her face was more pale, and her voice seemed to be struggling not to tremble.  “That wasn’t supposed to happen.  I only called your sister.”

My voice croaked.  “She came.”

Isabella nodded, but looked back toward the room.  “So did something else.”

She wouldn’t talk about it much.  I tried to tell her what I’d seen, give what details I could muster.  She seemed frightened, saying only that she would need more time to think about it, to try to understand what had happened.  That she had seen my dreaming body fly away, and the whole of the ritual had nearly been taken from her, that a power much greater than a simple ghost had found a doorway into the space.  I felt like she knew more, but she wouldn’t say anything else.  I tried to ask her about what I’d said, what words Mallory had said that had come through my lips, but she acted like she was afraid to hear me even repeat them.

Though I didn’t want to, I slept on her couch that night, not safely able to drive even to the hotel.  After some long hours asleep I finally woke.  Unable to help myself I went to look in the room from the night before, but it was now just a room, the chalk no longer on the floor, the candles put away.  Bookshelves and a little table, nothing more.  I went downstairs.  The shop wasn’t open yet, Isabella was cutting open a few boxes.  I walked over to where she was working.

“I’m going to go.”

She stood and walked toward me.  “Ok.”

“I’d say thanks for letting me stay here…”

“Yeah, since I drugged you, I don’t think you have to.”

I nodded.  “I’m heading back home.  Probably do something morbid like go look at Mallory’s grave.  Try to figure out how this happened.”

“Yeah.”

I shrugged.  “Bye, then.”

She followed me toward the door.  “I’m sorry it ended up like this.”

“It just is what it is, I guess.”

I got to the door, put my hand on the latch to unlock it.  I looked back at her.  “Last night… was any of that real?  Or was it just the drug?”

She shook her head.  “All I gave you was a little valium.”

I nodded.  “Alright.”

I opened the door and walked out.  She called after me.  “Chris, be careful, Ok?  I don’t know what that was last night.  I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Yeah.  I will be.”

She watched as I got in the car and drove away.
