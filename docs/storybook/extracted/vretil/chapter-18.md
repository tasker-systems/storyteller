Epistle Twelve, blood, as it has ever been.

It is symptom of your madness, this clinging to such failing reason.  The act is all that consecrates.  She has never concerned for why.

I have waited here too long, and have forgotten even what light as she might bring.  It is black here, and I have been alone.

You come now and I scream with clenching teeth that you have no right.  Whatever I have done to guide, in this sacred silent space, I am raped by your presence, by the sound of gasping breath, of such callousness as spoken word so long unuttered.  In this the holiest of holies, you are profane.  I have become the white sow, and whatever she may love of you, I will have my share.

But she calls you and I submit.

With my dagger, I submit.

With my serpent, I submit.

With my hate and hope, I submit.

And you, with your blood.  You will to her as well, submit.

-----

I was a child again, waking from a nightmare, and like all such dreams I was torn between trying to remember, and trying to forget.  I sat up in bed shaking, pulling my sheets to me.  Mallory was asleep across the room from me in her bed, no sound but soft, quiet breaths.  I was no more than six years old, though this did not seem strange to me.  It was the dark places on the floor and beneath the beds that occupied me now.  I called to Mallory, my young voice trembling.

“Mal…  I had a bad dream.”

She stirred but didn’t wake.  I called again, more loudly.  “Mallory, are you awake?”

She didn’t answer.  I steeled myself.  It had been nothing, just a dream.  I would go to the bathroom and get a drink.  Six, I decided, was too old to still be afraid of the dark.  I pushed the blankets off and leapt out from the bed enough that nothing beneath it could easily grab my exposed ankles, knowing better than to put them down too close to the dark under the bed.  I pulled open the bedroom door.  There was a nightlight on in the hall, and I was grateful for it as I walked toward the bathroom.

A sound came from the kitchen.  The hands on the grandfather clock in the hallway said it was past four in the morning.  I knew no one should be awake now.  But there was the sound again, and then a hushed voice.  Maybe more than one, I couldn’t hear well enough to be sure.  The bathroom and a drink abandoned, I began to walk very slowly toward the kitchen, tucked tight against the wall.

I stopped just before I reached it, and I listened.  The voices of a woman and a man were talking low, as if angry but hushing their words.  I peeked around the corner as carefully as I could.  I didn’t recognize them.  Why were they in my house, I wondered.  The man was wearing black, but the woman was standing where I could not see.  I tried very hard to listen.  The man was speaking.

“If he is to die, can we not just kill him now, and be done with it?”

“It is not that kind of death.”

“But you have spoken of his blood, spilt upon the ground.”

“You have heard only the grosser part of it.  He cannot die today.”

“Then can we take him, and hold him until such day does come?”

“He must make the choice.  It is not our sacrifice, but his.”

“Then take him still, and raise him, that he knows nothing but what he must to, in that crucial moment, act.”

Her voice came more insistent, and decidedly more firm.  “No.  I will not.  She will be born in a new way or not at all.”

“And if he fails?”

“Then we fail, with him.”

“You are a fool, woman.”

“It is my decision to make.”

“Then why are we here?”

“I wanted to see him.  To make myself sure.”

The man swore and pushed past her and out of the house, through the back door.  I could see the woman now, her hair dark and her eyes sharp.  She turned as if to follow him, but her eyes caught me.  She stopped.  “You should be asleep, child.”

I looked at her but I was small, and I froze, unable to speak.  She walked toward me, drawing nearer and kneeling down.  She put a hand at my face and she held my eyes with hers.  “You are so very small, and what we will ask of you is great.  And you will never know the nature of it.”  She seemed sorry for me, her eyes sad.  She brushed my cheek with her fingers and stood.  “But you will do well.  I can see it in you.”

She turned and walked away, and went out through the back door, walking across the porch and gone.  I stood still in the kitchen and didn’t know what to do.  And then it seemed she returned, walking back across the porch and toward the house.  But she had changed in those few minutes, her hair thinner with white flecks in it.  Her eyes were more terrible and they held none of the softness they had but a moment before.  And like I suddenly remembered my nightmare, the old woman stood in the doorway.  Her red hand and the other with a blade and she looked down at me, angry.  She spoke and she did not try to be quiet as before.

“This wasn’t for you, to listen or to see.  I was a fool, once.  You should never have taken such a place.”  I turned and I began to run away from her.  She shouted after me.

“I will chase you wherever you run.  I will be there wherever you go.  I am every shape.  I am every form, I am in every thought and memory.  I am in every place you have been or may ever hope to be.  I am in your dreams and your imaginings.  You may run.  But I have waited long, and you will not escape.”

I was a child but I knew I was not really, anymore.  There was a scattered self in my thoughts, a memory of a me from a place far from here, standing in the dark.  The fear of memory and her in my door crawled over my skin and arced up my legs.  I screamed and ran from the kitchen, and toward the front door.  She was behind me, laughing at me as I ran.  I went through the front door and pulled it closed, and I ran out toward the street.

A firm hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back.  As if from a daydream I awoke, and realized I had almost run into traffic.  I looked at the hand on my shoulder, and followed the arm up to a face.  There was a stern looking woman staring down at me, her hair dark, her eyes sharp.  She reached down and took my hand.

“You’ve got to watch where you’re going.”

Something had happened just before, but it seemed to be fading, a fancy of my wandering mind.  I looked up at her and nodded.  “Yes, ma’am.  I’m sorry.”

She squeezed my hand gently in acknowledgement.  The light turned and we began to walk across the street, as she firmly led me by the hand.  “Do you remember what I was saying?”

I looked around.  I knew I was eight, and that I was good at remembering what she told me.  I didn’t know why, but I wanted to remember for her, to make her happy or proud.  I apologized.  “No, ma’am.”

“Then I will start again.  But pay attention.  There will be a day when this will matter very much, and then I will not be with you, or not as I am now.”

I nodded.  “I will.”

“I have told you many times of the secret lady.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Have you yet begun to wonder why?  Why we would hope to bring forth a thing newly divine, when there seem already to be so many others?”

I didn’t answer right away.  I hadn’t thought to wonder why, but I did not know there were more, either.  I shook my head.  “What others?”

She laughed, and we stepped up over a curb.  She pulled me to the side and we stopped for a minute.  We were in a large city, there were many people milling about us, coming and going.  There were large buildings stretching tall above us, and cars on the street honking horns and revving engines.  The woman pointed up to the tallest building.

“Who do you think built that?”

I shrugged.  “Men with trucks and cranes.”

She nodded.  “They did.  Do you know why?”

I shook my head.

She looked back toward it.  “Because they needed temples, in order to worship the most avaricious of these others.”

I looked at the building.  It was sleek and tall, and there were people going into it and coming out of it, some carrying briefcases, others talking rapidly to another one beside them, everyone seeming very busy.

“That is not a temple,” I said back.  “It’s where people go for their jobs.”

She nodded.  “That is also true.  But not all of the truth.”  She turned and we walked a little bit farther, down another block, until we were in the shade.  We found ourselves in front of a church, great stone steps and stained glass, tall spires at the top, reaching into the air.  It was not as tall as the other buildings, but more beautiful than them.  There were a few people about, but not as many as coming and going before.  She looked and she gestured toward it.  “How about this one then?  Is it a temple?”

I nodded.  “Yes.”

“And within it, is there a god?”

I looked at her.  “I don’t know.”

She knelt down next to me, and we looked together.  She smiled and she turned and whispered in my ear, as if she were telling me a secret.  “There is, but he is old, and at long last stretched too thin.  And his dying son has other stories now to tell.”

I looked at her.  “Who is he?”

She just shook her head and stood and we began to walk again.  We walked for a long way this time, and my legs were shorter than hers and I began to grow tired.  She pulled at my hand gently.  “A little farther.”  We stopped in front of yet another building, this one with many columns at the front.  She pointed at it.

“Do you know what building that is?  We’ve been here before.”

I nodded.  “It is the capital building.”

She smiled.  “It is.  What do you think?  Are there gods in there?”

I turned to look, and I thought.  “I don’t know.  But I don’t think so.”

She shook her head.  “They are hidden, but they are there, too.  There are many gods that find their way to its steps, though most are petty and quickly fade.  But some are dangerous and very old, and lash so violently when threatened that we send tanks and bombs and guns to ease their fears.”  She looked down at me very seriously, her voice taking on a hard and darker tone.

“They are not enough.  These gods restrain and bind us, for they are so very small.  There are grander things beyond, and we have no one yet to guide us.”

Her voice was quiet, and low.  “But we will.  Won’t we, child?”

I nodded because I was supposed to, without understanding, and sat down.  My legs were tired and she sat down next to me.  She looked at me kindly, the firmness in her eyes for a moment softening.  “That is enough for now.  But you must remember what we speak of as we walk.  You will, won’t you?”

I nodded.  “I will try.”

She turned and reached into her purse.  She turned back, and in one hand she held a small red notebook, and in the other a shiny new mechanical pencil.  She held them out to me.  “You are old enough now.  I want you to try to write down the things you remember, each night when we’ve walked together, whatever you think was important.”

I looked at the pencil and the notebook, ready to take them, but as she sat there the image of her seemed strange.  The notebook seemed to become part of her hand, and the silver of the mechanical pencil seemed to lengthen and expand.  I looked and there was now from between dark hair and the shape of younger skin an old woman looking through.  And the gentility so recently found in her eyes was gone, and I had a feeling as if clouds had passed before the sun.  I stood and began to back away.  She opened her mouth like a smile, but all I saw were teeth.  She began to approach, and I shouted in a fear I had only just abandoned, and I turned again and ran.

I pushed open the door to my apartment.  I looked around confused, not sure how I’d gotten there.  On the table by the door was a stack of textbooks, though I knew they weren’t mine.  I shook my head trying to refocus, something slipping away from me.  Something behind me and something before me both vying for memory.  I heard Mallory in the bathroom crying, and things clicked into place.  She had just dropped out of school.  She had told me something incoherent about it the night before on the phone, then called me this afternoon to say she’d be here soon.  I walked to the bathroom door and knocked.

“Hey, Mal?  I’m home, I left work as quick as I could.”

There wasn’t an answer, just the sound of more muffled crying.

“Mal, it’s going to be Ok.  We’ll work this out.”

I heard a few ragged breaths being taken.  Her voice came shakily from the bathroom.  “You’ve forgotten, haven’t you?”

“What do you mean, Mal?  Forgotten what?”

There was a moment of silence, and then she pulled open the door, standing there thin and shaking, eyes swollen, tears streaked down her face.  “You’ve forgotten her.  I know you have.”  She pushed past me and walked into the living room.  She wiped at her face, then looked back at me.

“She never mattered to you.  Why you?  Why were you chosen?  I would have remembered her.  I would have loved her like I was supposed to.”  She turned and looked at me, a strange mania on her face.  She hit me in the chest.  “I would have loved her!  You never even wanted to!”

I tried to take her arms in mine, to quiet her.  She resisted, but I held on to her, pulling her toward me.  She collapsed against me and sobbed.

“She’ll never come, now.  She won’t love us.  And if she doesn’t love us…”  She didn’t continue but just sobbed.

I tried to sit her down on the couch and look at her, have her look back at me.  I spoke quietly, reassuringly.  “I thought this was about school.”

She looked at me incredulously.  “School?  Do you think it matters right now?  That I learn who devoured the grain of barley, or that I know why the king is lame?”

I shook my head.  “What are you talking about?”

“You!  She is waiting for you and you sit here like it doesn’t matter, like you can’t even remember!  I have loved her longer than you, and hidden it from everyone!  She said I must keep silent, but I won’t do it anymore.  And even if you are my brother, I would have your birthright!”

She pushed me away and she stood up from the couch, and rushed to the kitchen.  She picked up a knife.

I stood up slowly and tried to speak calmly, imploring her.  “Mal…  just calm down, Ok?  We can make all of this right.  Just… put it down.  It’s me.  Chris.”

“I know who you are.  And I know what she would have of you, and what you are so reluctant to give.”

“Ok…  just put it down, Mal.  Tell me about it instead.  You don’t need a knife to talk to me about it.”

She looked at me with nothing but scorn on her face.  “This knife isn’t for you.”  She looked at her hands, and she raised them to me, palms out, fingertips flexed.  “Look.  I will show you.  I will give her what you refuse.”

She took the knife and she stabbed it into her palm and pulled it across, and blood began to stream down.  I ran toward her and she lunged at me.  Behind her eyes she was no longer herself.  Her hair began to change, growing whiter.  Her skin grew older.  She lifted her red hand to me and I suddenly remembered the old woman and she was standing in my sister’s place, and through the streaked tears of her doubled face she began to laugh.  I cried out and reached for the knife before she could come at me, but she was gone.  My momentum carried me and I stumbled, falling to the floor.

“Oh my god!  Are you Ok?”

My eyes were closed, the side of my face hurt.  I held my eyes shut trying to remember.  There was something terrible just behind me, I could almost still see it.  But it slipped from me and I opened my eyes.  Stephanie was kneeling beside me, her hand on my back, looking intently down at me.  I blinked and rolled over, and looked at the chair.  My head cleared and began to hurt, but I started laughing.  I slowly sat up and held my head for a minute.  She just looked at me concerned, worrying.

“Chris, are you alright?  You fell really hard.”

I laughed again, my cheek hurting, working my jaw.  “Yeah, yeah, I’m Ok.  Good grief, I nearly killed myself in that chair.”

She touched my arm, reached to my face.  “God, you really scared me.”

I leaned over and kissed her forehead, then kicked at the chair from where I was sitting.  “No more standing in things with wheels on the bottom.”

She said softly “I tried to tell you…”

I laughed again, and put my hand on my knee, standing up.  “I know, I know.  You did.  Totally my fault.”

I looked around the room.  We were in our new house.  I had finished my degree, gotten a new job.  It had taken all the money and credit we could scrape together, but we had gotten this little house.  We were standing in one of the side bedrooms, there was no furniture in it, just drop cloths and buckets of paint.  The wheeled chair was there because I was using it to stand on while cleaning the last junk out of a closet.

She playfully punched me in the stomach.  “After all of this, you better not die that stupidly.  I’m not sure I’m up for this alone.”

I bent down and kissed her belly.  “You don’t get to raise our baby girl all by yourself.”

“Get to?”

I laughed.  She stroked my head.

“You sure you’re Ok?”

“Yeah.”

She patted my hair and turned around, walking back to the paint she had been mixing.  She bent down and stirred a little more, then turned to look back at me.  “Oh, you never answered me the other day.”

“About what?”

“I asked if we had really gotten together before you went off to New Mexico, or if that was just one of those… ripples, you talked about.  The things that happened backward.”

I hesitated.  “I don’t… I’m not sure what you’re asking.”

“You’re the one always going on about it.  The things that, you know, became part of your past after New Mexico.  The things that weren’t there before.”

Something felt strange.  “I don’t know what you mean.  Why… why are we talking about this now?”

She turned to me and laughed.  “You’re always like this about that trip!  One minute you can’t shut up about it, the next you act like you can’t remember what I’m even talking about.”  She smiled and stood up.  “Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal.  You can tell me some other time if you’d rather.”

She picked up a putty knife and looked at me.  “But, you can’t just stand there looking stunned all day.  We’ve got painting to do, sir.  Do you want to finish patching some of the walls in the other rooms, or do you want to paint in here?”

She smiled at me and she knelt down, and she slowly put her whole hand in the paint.  I looked at her, surprised.  “What are you doing?”

She pulled her hand up from the bucket, and it was pink.  The color we were going to paint the baby’s room.  She stood up, putty knife in one hand, the other pink and dripping paint on the drop cloth.  She stared at me strangely and began to walk forward.  “Even here, I know you.  Even here, I can find you.”

“What?”

Her face began to change, eyes no more her own.  The pink ran red.  I began to shake, knowing what was happening now, and I turned.  A laugh that wasn’t hers followed me out the door.  I ran out of the baby’s room and toward the living room.  I could hear her steps behind me, and laughter, and darkness following her down the hall.

“Hey, hey, whoa.  Slow down.”

I caught myself before I ran into the side of a chair.  I looked around, the nagging feeling again, like I had been having it over and over, something just behind me.  Something I kept forgetting.  The lighting was dimmer here, it was nighttime through the windows.  Isabella was sitting in her living room, pouring a second glass of wine for us both.  I ran my hands over my eyes.

“I’m sorry.  I don’t… I felt like I was somewhere else.”

She looked at me, concern on her face.  “Are you feeling Ok?”

I walked around the chair, picked up my glass and sat down.  “Yeah, I’m fine.  Just felt strange for a moment.”

She set the bottle down and stood up from her chair, walked over to sit next to me.  She sat closer than I was comfortable with, but I didn’t move.  I drank some of my wine and looked at the coffee table.  She had set a totem figure there, of a goddess and a god in mid-coupling.

“So, you were explaining.”

She smiled, turned from where she was sitting and picked up the figure from the table, leaning back and looking at it.  “It’s…  maybe it’s easier if you think of it like psychology.”

“Ok.”

“There are all of these drives in us.  Instincts and desires, abstractions and concepts, hopes and dreams.  Things that make us human and from before we were human, all of them twisting together out of biology and history and memory to make us into these creatures that we are.”

She reached for her wine, and handed me the statue.  I looked it over.  I thought maybe it was Indian, though I didn’t really know.  She drank then looked at it in my hand, leaning closer to me, her shoulder pressing against mine.  “But all of that stuff, each piece of it, comes from some other place, deeper down into us.  Out of our unconscious, whatever was before our minds as they are now.  But all of those deeper things are aware, too.  With personalities and wills and patterns of being.  Maybe not conscious the way we are, but aware in their own way.  Imprinting on us desires and modes of action and being.”

“And what does that have to do with waving sticks and knives around, standing in circles, and talking to mirrors?”

She laughed.  “On its own, nothing.  Like I said, it’s like psychology.  We want these things inside us to do what we say, to stop acting out of turn, to stop leading us around and pressing us so hard to do things we may not even want to do.  They can sometimes influence us so much though that we feel like what they want must have really been our own thoughts and ideas.  Like when someone says ‘I wasn’t myself that day’ or ‘I don’t know what came over me.’  All they mean is that one of these things acted in them, and their conscious will got pushed aside.”

She stood up, took the statue from me, walked toward the mantle of the fireplace.  She put it back and began to light candles, not looking at me, but speaking.

“Still, it’s not just when we don’t want them.  They can lend us all sorts of strength and energy to do the things we want.  If we can get them to work for us, they can make us far more capable than we might be by ourselves.  I like to call them gods.  Or demons.  It helps me to think of them as unique things, different from myself.  And we have all these old tools left around, things most people have forgotten about, to talk to them, to try to make them answer us.  I just use them.  I use old names that aren’t really fitting, sometimes because I don’t have better ones.  I call out to gods and goddesses that have evolved and become something different than they were before, whose names now only half-apply.  The whole world has changed, and is even now greatly changing.  We’re on the cusp of it.  I speak to them by holy names, but these will be something else, soon.”

She looked back at me and smiled.

“None of this makes any real sense, does it?”

I shook my head.  “I don’t know.  I don’t know if I really buy it.”

She shrugged.  “That’s Ok.  It’s only part of the truth, anyway.”

She walked back toward me and reached for her glass.  As she did she bumped it and it fell, crashing down to the floor, shattering the glass and spilling wine.

“Oh, damn.  Hold on.”  I stood up and pushed the couch back and out of the way of where it had spilled.  The floors were wooden, so there was no rug to stain, but I tried to push the furniture out of the way.  She came back with paper towels, bending down and cleaning it up.  I went over and picked up a broom and dust tray for the glass.

She looked over at me.  “Thanks.”

“Yeah, no problem.”

She stood up, one hand holding the shattered stem of the glass, the other holding a handful of purple-stained towels.  She looked at me.  The image seemed suddenly familiar.  One of her eyes changed where a shadow fell across her face.  Her hair became silvered, taking on frosted tips.  Her posture changed, and she turned to face me, taking a slow advancing step.

“Her gods will not stand in my way, and they will not come for you in our holy darkness.”  She walked toward me, purple stained towels and a sharp stem of a glass.  She raised them toward me and I stumbled backward.  I skirted around the edge of the room and began to run for the stairs.  She called after me.  “There are gods and there are gods, and such as hers will not restrain me!  You cannot run forever!”

I turned and fled down the stairs, and through the shop.  I ran out the door.

I knew.  This time I knew I had just run from something, that this seemed to be happening over and over.  I could not remember what it was, and I struggled with the vapors of almost memory, but they again slipped from me.  I was standing in a small garden, one of stone and cacti.  I looked up and saw Sarah sitting on a bench a few yards away, wearing the same large sweater around her tiny frame.  She waved to me, calling me over.

“It’s nice to see you.  I didn’t know you would be coming by.”

I shook my head.  I tried to fight the sense of place slipping in around me.  It was neither false nor true, but it was not where I had been, nor where I suspected I could fully be said to be.  I looked at her.  “This isn’t real.”

She shrugged, and gestured to a space on the bench next to her.  “It is not so important for it to be.  Sit.”

I walked to her and I sat down.  My face was tight, suspicious.  “You know what’s happening here, don’t you?”

“I do.”

“Tell me.”

She laughed, and patted my knee.  “It would take far too long.  You don’t have much time.”

“I don’t understand.  Time for what?”

“You are going to die tonight, child.  I had hoped you would have discovered that by now.”

“What?  How can you know that?”

“It has always been this way.  Since the moment it began.”

“Since what began?  What is going on?”  She didn’t answer.  I looked at her pleadingly.  “What am I supposed to do?”

“You are only supposed to die.  I’m sorry, child.  There is no malice in it from me, though that will not help you.”

“Why am I here then?  Why are we talking?”

“Because you are running.  But you should ask, are you here for yourself, or because there are five stations of the three of waxing and waning?”

“Please.  I don’t understand.  There has to be something I can do.”

She smiled.  “There is.  But you must be the one to find it.”  She reached out and squeezed my hand as if to comfort me.  It did not.

“We are coming to the end, though as with all, it is that the next might begin.  Perhaps it is only that I am old, but I feel as if so much that was worthy has been lost.  There was wisdom, once, and magick and divinity, and stranger things even than they, among unspoiled groves and hidden springs.  I long for a world I have never seen.  There was a world that has withered, and has become desiccated, cracking and broken, where once brilliant life held sway.  But that is the way of things, and a new world turns.  Newer things will blossom, soon, though I do not know if I will be ready to see.”  She paused and she looked away from me and out over the barren sand behind us.  She spoke quietly, her voice far off.

“We return to the well.  What has become dried and dead will bear unexpected seed, and this that which must be so delicately tended.  We will write new songs to a newer kind of gods, and perhaps in this age we will be aware, and face an unfolding world with greater wisdom and resolve.  There will be new symbols, and they will remind us of the old, but they will be their own.”

She paused, and took a breath, and sighed.  “I am old, and such things excite, but tire me.  I am sorry, only, that such renewal comes forever with such sacrifice.  The way of the wheel is blood.  It has ever been.”

She then bent down and reached into a small bag at her feet, and brought back up a pomegranate and small knife.  “Would you like some?”

Red hand and a knife, and I stood up and stepped back.  Sarah looked at me, nodding.  “Yes, child, she is coming.  Through me, I can feel her.  You have not long now, and you have nowhere left to run.”

She stood up from the bench.  The sky grew dark, as if the sun had set, and the stars failed to appear.  The garden began to fade.  Her face changed, and her clothes fell to the ground, a serpent shedding skin.  Sarah was gone and the old woman was in her place, smiling at me like watching me die.  Everything went dark once more.

-----

And we are now as we did begin, but I have no better answer.  The earth trembles, and the snake writhes in my hand.  I look and it is still a blade, but my palm must hold it tight that I am not stung.  I look out to the twelve candles that surround, but they provide no further aid.  She has pursued me here in the dust of this cave, I have started from shadows and cold breath.  She has pursued me through fantasy that I did not sleep to dream.  I have proclaimed loudly my ignorance, the depth of this folly.  And still there is a goddess coming and I am no more than I was before: ignorant, afraid, and alone.

For a moment there is a ring of nine nymphs about me, interleaved among the flickering twelve.  There are three thin and young, three voluptuous and full, and three that are hags and crones.  Every one is naked and starkly white, eyes too dark to do but glitter, teeth flashing like weapons.  I shake myself and they are gone.  The earth shakes harder, I hold fast with my open hand to the loose dust, but I am toppled down, and must wait until it passes to rise again.  There is a light from the purple-white flowers, but it is dim, and I can see no more than blossoms, all the rest is black.

I am going to die.  I know it now.  A calm takes me in the knowledge, though terror crawls along the bottom of it unrelenting.

I walk toward the candles, and I look at the images and the glyphs writ in the sand, studying them one by one.  I smile because even at the hour of my death there is no insight, tokens left for some other eye than my own.  A serpent coiled about an egg, my head eclipsing the dawning sun.  A weeping face buried in sorrowed hands, my knee bent in a somber place.  A bit of rope twined about my leg, a lonely cabin and a hawk, a great dark forest that dwarfs my frame, and fire burning above my head.  A seed held in my cupped palm, my hand laid begging on indifferent hem.  A spiral on a rock.  I know am the final glyph, here in the dark of this cave.  Only I do not divine the secret.

I return and walk to the flower, and it begins to glow more brightly.  The nine return, flickering, without stepping, but drawing nearer.  They are not there but they move and I can see them waiting.  Like foreknowledge I can see their hands taking and tearing me.  The ground begins like they to flicker, but as it does it shakes.  My moment’s calm flies from me and I am terrified again.  They are coming, maenad and baachae, and among them is the old woman, as if she now has become one with all the rest.  Or is all of them herself.  I do not know.  They flicker like projections of film on a wall.  I begin to tremble.

I do not want to die.  Not by their hands.  And the quaking of the earth calls forth a goddess and though I might learn to love her, neither for her will I die.  I would run but there is nowhere else.  The flowers glow, and the nine stalk me, ringed about and dropping now like animals to hands and knees.  Their eyes are dark, and their mouths are frothing, some already with blood of some other beast.  They move like things inhuman, and I close my eyes but I can see them still.  I look to the ceiling but there is only black, and there is another quake, this one more terrible, and a crack opens in the earth at my feet.  It is dark and there is a terrible heat.  I begin to scream.  I will not die for them or this.  They will tear me limb from limb and I will have given everything.  The goddess will take me into the earth, but I will not have her offered death.  I look upon them and my eyes turn hard, and I look into the earth, and I stand, taking the knife tightly in my hand.  I stand and they slow, and for a moment everything is still.

I look out upon them, and speak to the cracking open earth.   Words flow from me as if they are not my own, a sound of a voice projecting out into the echoed black. “This death is mine, and not by your hand.  My blood my own, myself to myself.”  I raise the knife, and shove it hard into my chest.  I scream but the sound is coughed and bubbled and quiet.  I fall down to my knees.

They are not there.  There is no movement and everything is silent.  No hands reach for me.  No eyes glint in the dark.  I fall down forward, and lie still.  I see my blood spread out below me, and see it ring the little plant, the flowers throwing their tiny light.  As if thirsty the soil already begins to absorb.

And then for a moment I see myself, my youngest self, walk from somewhere behind me, and go from here, standing now hand in hand with the old woman.  They are looking down on me, and though the terror is not gone from her, her eyes look into mine.  My youngest self is looking on, and then back up at the woman.  She looks down at him and nods, and to him, though not me, she smiles.  They turn and walk away until I cannot see, and soon my eyes go dark.
