The boy woke refreshed, feeling full of energy.  The old woman was already awake, butter sizzling in a pan atop the wood stove.  She smiled as she saw him stir.  “Good morning, young man.”  He stood and smiled back, breathing in deeply, his stomach rudely hoping for breakfast.

“Good morning, ma’am.”

“Did you sleep well?”

“Yes, I did.  I dreamt, too.  I dreamt because of the fire.”

“Did you now? Tell me about it, then.”

And so the boy related to her his strange dream, of the candle that would not let him stop, and the terrible things he had seen in the dark, and his face growing old and finally vanishing from the pool.  And he told her of sand, and the cave, and the seed, and the girl.  All of this the old woman listened to, while she flipped pancakes on the stove.  When she had a stack of them quite nicely prepared, she put them in front of the boy.

“It sounds to me as if the fire has answered, don’t you think?”

The boy nodded.  “I do.  But I do not know what it means.”

She laughed.  “Ah, now that’s the trick, isn’t it?  Many people know how to ask the fire.  It is easy, and the fire loves to tell what it sees.  But to interpret!  That is the art.”

The boy smiled because she laughed, and because he had pancakes.  “Can you interpret them?”

The old woman turned back to the stove, and pulled the pan away, and set a kettle on to boil.  She did not answer immediately, and when she did, her tone was strange.  “I can, child.  But there is a price.  Whether I would that there were or no, there is always a price.”

The boy grew serious as she did, and she turned to look at him.  For a moment he was caught by the sharpness of her eyes, and he saw before him not the kind old woman, but something else.  It faded as soon as it came, and she placed again a warm smile on her face, and though he thought that perhaps he had only imagined it, he decided to remember.  Once she smiled again, and he had finished a mouthful of pancake, he asked her “What is the price?”

“It is not something you can pay, now.  It is not something you can agree to pay.  It is a price that must come when you do not expect it, a price that you will not know is payment, until it has been done.”

The boy did not understand.  “I have nothing though, ma’am.  I have only these clothes you have given me.  I have no money, no horse, no family or home.  I cannot pay you but with what you provide, and that is no payment at all.”

She smiled, and she patted him gently on the arm.  “We will see, in time.”

He still did not understand, but he nodded.  “You will interpret my dream then?”

She sat down across the table from him.  “I will.  But it will not be as you imagine.”

“What do you mean?”

“I cannot look into your future, to tell you what might or may be.  That will be little different than the visions of the fire, an image, a sound, a word.”

The boy thought for a moment.  “What will you do?”

“I will tell you this.  It is the sand, the cave, the seed, and the girl upon which your thoughts must dwell.  It is after these we will follow.”

“Follow them how?”

“As life is lived, child.  We will walk and ride and we will find the place, and we will see what comes to us then.”

The boy nodded, and then a thought struck him.  “You said ‘we.’  I have traveled this far alone.”

She smiled.  “You need not do so any longer, child.  I will go with you, and we will find your sister, together.”

The boy was surprised, and he sat and thought in silence.  He thought that the old woman had been very kind, but he did not know her.  He did not know if she would lead him rightly, or if she could.  He did not know if she would travel quickly, or if she would detour to places of her own design.  But he thought that he had become lost in the bog, and might have stayed lost until he died, had she not happened upon him.  And so he smiled, and he thanked her.  “Yes, please, that would be wonderful.  I have been very alone.”

The old woman had seen the play of concern across his face, and she reached out again for his arm, and clasped it reassuringly.  “I have too, child.  And I would be very glad of a companion for a time.”

They prepared together, the old woman packing clothes for herself and the boy, putting her things in one pack, and his in another, smaller, to replace the one he’d lost.  She packed food and water skins and a bit of money between them.  Soon they were packed and ready to leave, the old woman put out the fire in the stove and the hearth.  She stood near the door, and mumbled to herself a list of things packed and needed, to be sure they had all they should before departing.

“Oh!” she said.  “I almost forgot.  A tinderbox.”  She walked to a cabinet, and pulled the little metal container from a shelf, and walked back to the boy.  “Here, you put it in your pack.  I’m sure you’re quite proficient by now.”

The boy smiled and took it, glad to be useful.  But as he looked at it, his face darkened.  This was his tinderbox.  It was the same.  He looked at the old woman suspiciously.  “Where did you get this?”

She looked back at him quizzically.  “I’ve had it for years.  My daughter and her son both used it as children.  I have used it a time or two myself, though I have others.”

He looked down at it again, but he was certain.  He recognized the dents in the metal, the dings on the surface.  He opened it and looked at the flint, and recognized the pattern of the scratch marks, even.  “This is mine.  It is the one that was taken from me.”

The old woman took it from his hand, and looked at it carefully.  She shook her head, confused.  “I don’t believe so, child.  It is the one I have had for many, many years now.  More years than you’ve lived.”  She extended it back to the boy.  “Many do look rather alike though.  Perhaps you are mistaken?”

He took it, and though he knew he was right, there was nothing more to say.  So he shrugged, and apologized.  “I’m sorry.  I must have been confused.  It just looks very much like my own, and I had promised to return it to the man from whom I borrowed it.”

She smiled, and opened the door, lifting her bag and putting it across her shoulder.  “Do not worry, child.  We will make right your debt, if you have it still when we return.”

The boy lifted his pack, and put it across his shoulders, and looked down one more time at the tinderbox.  It was his.  But he needed the old woman’s help to find his sister, and did not want to make her angry.  He put it in his bag, but he decided to remember this as well.

The old woman knew the way through the bog very well, the boy realized as they walked.  She seemed scarcely to touch the mud, her steps finding firmer ground than his, however he tried to follow.  And though he could not see the sky to tell, it seemed to the boy as if they had made remarkable progress.  It was only the next morning before they emerged from the bog, and set foot once again on grass and firmer ground, though now beyond the forest on the other side.  When they reached the edge of the trees, the old woman stopped for a moment.  She had a tear on her face, and the boy stopped with her, looking up.

“What’s wrong?”

She wiped it from her face and smiled, looking down at him.  “Nothing.  Nothing important.”  And she would not say more, but from time to time he would catch her with tears on her face, looking out over the sweeping fields and into the sky.  He did not understand, but they walked anyway.  They came upon a small town before the end of the second day, and the old woman rented a small room for them to rest.  The boy did not refuse, or decide this time to spend the night in the hay, but gladly took a mat on the floor, and they slept, and rose.  They continued this way, some nights sleeping beneath the stars, some in rented rooms in small towns, purchasing supplies when they could stop.  The boy was not sorry that he did not have to fish for a meal every night, though some nights he would, if there was water nearby.

As they walked, he wondered how she knew where they were going.  It had been his dream, and so far she had not told him what it meant any more than in the beginning.  Though they spoke of many things, and she seemed glad to teach him of birds and plants and trees and shrubs, of the sky and what weather it portended, she would not speak for long on dreams, before she would grow quiet, and the boy would see he should change the subject.  He did not understand her reluctance, for he knew she must know a great deal, and certainly more than he knew himself.  But she would not speak of it, and soon enough he ceased to ask.

But of other things she taught him much, and was very sorry to hear that he could not read for himself, and lamented that she had brought no books along, with which she might begin to teach him.  He was not distressed, no one he knew had learned to read, but there had been school planned for him when he was older.  At least, there had been a long time ago.  The old woman spent long hours silent, looking only at the road ahead, and at times like this she would seem more severe, her back more straight, her posture more noble, the boy thought.  When she spoke to him her back curved down, and she seemed small and friendly and warm, but when she thought he was not looking, or she forgot his presence altogether, her bearing changed, and her eyes were sharp, and her mouth was tight, and her long hair seemed a train of solemn decoration more than the stringy mess of a tired old woman.  At these moments he thought she must be someone else, someone other than she was pretending to be, not a little woman who lived in the bog, but a noblewoman, a queen even, who had perhaps been long hidden, with secrets kept hidden, too.  At other times he knew such thoughts to be but daydreams.  But whatever she may have been, he found that as days passed on the road, though she was kind to him and provided food and shelter, there was a wedge that grew between them, and it pressed upon them the further along they went.  She would speak to him no less, nor treat him differently, but her eyes became more often hard, and her voice was not so gentle as it once was.  But she never harmed or scolded him, and she was with him to find his sister, and that was for the time, enough.

And so they continued on, until one day they found themselves on a sloping hilltop, looking down on a city made of red earth, much larger and more expansive than any he had ever seen.  There were caravans on the road, some of which had passed them as they walked days before, and there were people with horses and oxen and mules bringing produce and wheat and all sorts of things into the city.  Coaches with guards clattered past on important business, and dairy farmers with milk and cheese plodded along, in no real hurry at all.  As they drew nearer, they took a ride with just such a farmer, who let them sit at the back of the cart.  And soon enough, they were within the walls of the city.  They made their way into its center, where the market overflowed with people.  They boy had never seen anything like it, not at least while waking, for there were hundreds or even thousands of people talking and bustling and moving about, every one going their own way and no one else’s, bickering, bartering, laughing, and shouting.  There were all manner of things to buy, though many the boy could think of no use for, or did not recognize at all.  The old woman seemed intent, knowing just where she was headed.  When they reached a particular shop, she turned around, and knelt down to look at the boy.

“I must go into this shop alone.  Take this,” she said, and put a few coins in his hand.  “Walk about for an hour.  Find something to eat, enjoy yourself.  Watch the people.  But please do not follow me.  I must speak privately, and they will not speak to me in front of anyone else, child or no.”

The boy nodded, and took the coins.  “How will you find me, when you are done?”

She smiled.  “I can find you, when I need to, little one.  Now go.”

And so the boy walked away, though to himself he thought that perhaps he would try to see who it was with whom the old woman needed to so privately speak.  He wandered about the market, but near the shop, not letting it out of his sight for very long at any time.  He bought some meat on a stick that turned out to not be as good as it had smelled at first, and certainly had cost more than it was worth.  He walked to the corner of a building across the street, and pulling a crate up beneath him, he sat down to wait.  What surprised him most was the roar, the constant background rumble of people and voices, of buying and selling, of coming and going.  After so many days walking alone, and then days walking along the open roads, voices heard at most one at a time, it was a strange and unexpected change.  He felt as if he couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, with so much noise.  As he sat, his suspicion waned, and he wanted, more than to know her secret, to be gone from the city.  It did not suit him, he decided, all the bustle and business.  Here he might not be so desperate as in the wilderness, but he felt he might be more alone.

He had ceased to carefully watch when he saw that the door had opened, and the old woman had emerged.  Behind her followed a man in black, and he took her hand and kissed it, as a lord might of a lady.  Her hair was tied back in a knot now, and she looked again more queen than crone.  The man in black startled the boy, for he was suddenly certain he recognized the man.  He was the one who had taken his pack from him, the one who had left him alone in the grasslands, unable to fend for himself.  And the man knew the old woman.  She had had his tinderbox, and there was only one way she could have gotten it.  The man turned and went back into the shop, and the old woman turned around.  When she did, she saw the boy now standing, staring angrily, accusation on his face.  She gestured for him to come across the square to her, and he did, his steps swift, anger in his little frame.  He did not wait for her to speak.

“You lied to me.  This is my tinderbox, and that is the man that stole from me.”

She looked at him, and laughed.  “That man there?  From the shop?”

The boy did not smile or laugh, but pointed at the shop door.  “Yes, that man.  He knows you.”

She looked behind her, as if unsure what he meant, but her smile did not leave her face, as if he were making a jest.  “Are you quite certain he is the one who stole from you?”

The boy nodded.  “Yes.”

She took his hand in hers.  “Alright then, let’s go ask him.  If he stole as you say, then we should find out why he would do such a thing.”

The boy had not expected such a response, and he drew his hand away.  “But he will say he did not do it.”

She shrugged.  “It is possible, yes.  He may lie, or he may be telling the truth, and either way only you will know for sure.  And even that must be in doubt, yes?  For as you told me, he was very far away.  Could you have seen his face?”

The boy paused, his anger still hot in his mind, but he knew he had lost.  Finally he shook his head.  “No.  I could not have seen it.  Not enough to be sure.”

The woman put her hand on his shoulder.  “If you would still like to ask him, I will go with you.  It is always possible he will tell the truth.”

The boy shook his head, and sighed.  “No, it does not matter.  I will not be nearer my sister, whether he tells the truth or no.”

She smiled and squeezed his shoulder gently, looking kindly down at him.  “You are wise, little one, to think clearly in the face of your anger.  It will change nothing to know the answer to some questions.  To leave behind the wrong done you is often the only solution.”

The boy did not feel better from hearing this, but it sounded like the truth.  From then on though, the boy decided to more closely keep to his own counsel.  He did not know what the woman wanted, nor why she helped, and though he was sincerely grateful, he did not know if he could trust her completely.

They left the city the next morning, and the landscape began, gradually at first but then more quickly, to lose its waving grasses, and show instead rolling dunes of sand, punctuated by boulders and massive stones.  By the second day there was only rock and sand.  When they stopped to rest, it was on the rocks, though they were hard and unforgiving.  In the daylight they were hot to the touch, and sitting was as if baking on them, though by night when the temperature would grow cold, they would hold their warmth for long enough to sleep, at least for a while.  What shrubs and twisted tiny trees there were did not leave enough behind for much fire, and there was only water enough to refill skins, never enough to fish for fresher food.

The boy began to grow weary.  The road had already been very long, and though the woman seemed to intend his help, he did not know if he could trust her.  He was tired of walking and tired of following after her.  He was hot, and the sun was merciless here with no trees, no shade, and little water.  The night winds were cold and unforgiving, and he would wake every morning with sand crusted at his eyes.  He wanted to be home, wherever that might be.  He began to think that perhaps his sister was unattainable, no longer within his meager reach.  He spoke less and less, and the old woman seemed to grow more hard and severe, the landscape and the heat making her less gentle.  She would stop and wait when he would lag behind, but there was no word of encouragement now as there once had been.  She ceased to teach him things, but he would not have cared to learn them now.  This land was not made for people, or not those so soft as a child who had been walking for days and days.

Their progress was slowed too by the caves.  As they walked further, more caves began to open beside them, below them.  Some with broad entrances, obvious and wide, others with but shadowed recesses one step away from careless footing.  Many the old woman would stop beside, and insist upon inspecting, asking the boy about the markings he had dreamed, matching them to things she saw or knew.  Her questions were not for conversation, requiring function only of clear and forthright answers.  They walked and they hunted for a cave that the boy did not remember clearly.  And the further along they progressed, the slower their movements, as caves and pitfalls became ever more prevalent.  They never walked more than an hour before stopping to investigate some cavern or cave mouth, though the boy did not know what it was they looked for, nor what would signify a matching to the figures in his dreams.

And then finally there was a cave mouth on a hillside, far up from where they were standing, and the boy saw it, and pointed.  “It is there.  That is the cave.”  The old woman looked at him blankly, and then put her hand to her eyes to shield them from the sun, and looked where he pointed.  She said nothing, but began to climb the rock face herself.  She was agile, more than she seemed she could be the boy thought, and her limbs were longer than his.  He could not easily follow where she had gone, but had to pick out his own way.  When he finally met her atop the cliff, she smiled at him, the first she had in days.

“You were right, child.  This is it.  How did you know?  Had you not pointed, we would have passed it by.”

The boy looked at her and shrugged without commitment.  “I don’t know.  It just seemed like it must be.”

The woman laughed, and she took out a water skin, and drank more than she had been allotting them at any one time, and let the boy do the same.  “Smile, little one.  We are here after all.”

“But what is here?” the boy asked, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, and stoppering the water skin.

“I can only guess,” she said to him.  “But we can go in, and find out together.”

The boy nodded, and looking into the slow slope of the cave, had some of his weariness lift from his mind, happy that they had made it so far.

At first he could not see when they passed into the cave.  It was dark inside, and after the harsh glare of the sun, it may as well have been pitch black.  The woman had a small lantern, and she lit it, but it was very little help.  They walked down into the earth, careful of their footing, climbing when they must.  They reached a particularly steep descent, and the old woman extended her hand to the boy.  He looked at her, but refused to take it.  He put his hands on the side of the wall, and though the way was harder without her help, he managed it alone.  Eventually the descent began to even out, and they found themselves in a small, open space.  The light of the lantern did not reach far, and so they slowly made their way about the edge.

And then he saw her.  Lying still beside a small spring, wrapped in a dark blanket, his sister was there on the cave floor.  The boy shouted and ran to her, and fell to the ground on his knees beside her.  He was weeping with joy and relief and other things that did not have easy names.  He clasped her hand and he touched her face, calling to her.  But she would not rouse or wake.  She did not flutter an eyelid, nor did her breathing change from its slow and gentle regularity.  He cried, and his tears fell on her cheek, but she did not move to brush them.  His eyes were blurred as he turned to the old woman, all suspicion held in abeyance, that only she might help his sister.

“She will not wake,” he said to her, and she nodded gravely.

“So I see.”  She extended the lantern to him, and he took it.  She pulled back her sleeves and she pulled up her hair, and she passed beside the boy, and knelt.  She took his hand and pulled it over the girl.  “Hold the lantern here,” she said, and so he did.  The old woman leaned down close, listening to the girl’s breath, and she felt for a pulse, and other things the boy did not recognize.  She felt her throat, and moved her joints, but the boy saw no change.  Finally the old woman sat back, and took the lantern from the boy, setting it on the ground.

“What is wrong with her?” the boy asked.

The old woman did not answer immediately, but took her time, thinking.  When she did answer, she was only in part speaking to the boy.  “I thought it might be so,” she said, her voice low.  She turned to look at him.  “Someone has stolen much of your sister’s soul,” she said to the boy.  “How or when I do not know, but that it has been taken.”

“What can we do?” the boy cried, his heart very near to breaking.  He had come so far, to find her still so hurt.

“You dreamt your answer, though only now I see it.  We must grow your sister’s soul anew.  The seed you’ve dreamed, you must now find.”

“How will I know it?” the boy asked.  “It was but a seed, and though the plant was strange and beautiful, the seed was like any other seed.”

“You must find help then, from one who knows.”

The boy thought for a moment, and then realized, “Does that mean you will not go with me?”

The old woman nodded.  “I will stay with your sister, and tend to her as best I can.  You must find the seed without me.”

The old woman rose and opened her bag.  She took from it a shirt, and ripped it into shreds, and a stick and wrapped them about the end.  She tied them and took a very small amount of lantern oil, and dampened the fabric with it.  She lit it carefully with the lamp.  “Be careful that it does not go out while you climb.  I will wait, but you must hurry.”  The boy thought, and he looked at his sister.  He did not know what else to do.  He went to her and he kissed her cheek, and he took her hand again, and for a moment or two, he cried.  The old woman touched his shoulder gently, and her voice was, for the moment, kind.  “You must go, little one.”

So the boy took the torch, and turned to walk back as they came.  His thoughts tossed and tumbled in his head, of where he might look, who he might ask for help.  There was no one near this place.  Slowly he began to climb, his progress slowed by one hand holding the flame.  It was hot and it did not give much light, and he was often close to burning himself with it or putting it out, as he clambered up the rocks.  But he worked his way up, until he could again see sunlight.  He set the torch down and stomped it out, and left it near the entrance, so that he might find it again when he returned.

He stopped outside the cave, and he thought.  He had been on the trail below for many days, and had seen no one.  The trail was too low, and the boulders and walls of rock made it hard to see what might be about him on either side, and so before he climbed down, he climbed up.  He thought that if he could get above the trail and above the boulders and rocks and walls, he could look out around him.  If there were homes or a village or even a traveller passing by, he would know better from above than below.  The ascent was not easy.  The gravel was slippery beneath his feet, and the rocks trembled when he stepped on them, as if they did not want to hold his weight.  But they did, and he found his way to the top.  The landscape surrounding was much as that by the trail, rocks and dust and caves.  There were no proper trees, only scraggly plants and bushes, twisted and knobby bits of brush, sprigs of dried out grass like sparse tufts of hair.  But down the hill and off to the south there was a house.  It was of red mud-brick like the city before, and if he had not looked carefully he might not have seen it at all.  It was the color of the land around it, and it looked almost like a strange stone.  His heart leapt though, for a house meant people, and people who lived here might know of his seed.  He began to climb down the far side of the hill, making his way toward the house.

It had grown dark before he reached it, but the moon had risen and he could see clearly.  There were no clouds or trees to block the light, and though it was not so clear as day, he could find his way just fine.  He knocked on the door politely, but loudly enough that anyone inside might hear, for he thought that they would not be expecting anyone to be passing by this way.  Steps came toward the door, and it was pulled open, and a lantern was held up to see.  He could see the friendly eyes of a woman, dark hair and a round face with sun-brown skin, and she smiled very largely, but curiously, at the boy.  “What are you doing out here alone, child?”

“I’m looking for a seed, to help my sister,” he answered truthfully.

“A seed?” the woman replied.  “Come inside, and tell me.”

Inside there was food cooking, though he was not sure what kind.  The woman had two daughters and a son, though the son was still very young, and his middle sister held him.  The oldest girl was tending something in a pan.  The woman took his bag from him, and set it by the door, and led him in to sit.  The children smiled but did not speak, and the mother sat near him.  “Are you hungry?” she asked.

The boy was, very much, but could not stop to eat now.  He thanked the woman, but said no.  “I must find a seed,” he said.  “My sister has grown ill, and the old woman who has helped me says that I must find the seed, that we might restore her soul.”

The woman looked at him strangely, with a little frown on her face.  “I don’t know about such things as that, my boy.”

The boy’s face was desperate, “I do not either.  But my sister is sick, and nothing else will help her.”

They were silent for a moment, then the eldest daughter spoke.  “Do you know what the seed looks like?”

The boy shook his head.  “I do not.  But the flowers… in my dream they were purple, some white, and they were shaped like bells.”

The woman turned to look at her daughter, and she rose.  “Wait here,” she gestured to the boy.  She walked out of the house through a door behind the kitchen.  When she returned, she held a blossom in her hand, but delicately, by the stem.  “Like this?” she asked, though her face had a strange look on it.

The boy’s eyes brightened.  “Oh, yes, that is it!  How did you know?”

The woman shook her head.  “I did not.  But I purchased these seeds on a whim.  The man who sold them to me told me they were beautiful at night, though they were deadly poison.  They have been blossoming for weeks, and dropping pods of seeds.”  She led the boy outside, to a small porch of with wooden benches and tables, all covered with pots of flowers.  “They do not grow here well, and I have had to keep water on them more than most.  But they are very beautiful.”  She picked up a small spherical pod, and cracked its husk to show the boy the seeds inside.  She led him inside, and wrapped it in a bit of cloth.  “It is very poisonous, you would do well to handle it carefully.”

She handed the small bundle to him, and washed her hands.  He took it and placed it in his pack.  “Thank you very much.  I will be careful.”

She smiled at him, but the trouble had not left her face.  “You said this was for your sister?  You must be careful that she does not swallow these, nor drink tea from them.  They will kill her.”

The boy nodded.  “I will be careful.  There is a healer with her, waiting for me.  She will know what to do.”

The woman nodded, but did not seem convinced.  “Go to your sister then, child.  I wish you both well.”

“Thank you,” he said, and took up his bag, and left.

“You were right to bring her here,” the old woman said.  There was a man in the cave standing beside her.  He had long brown hair and a beard, and his clothes were plain.  He stood quietly, looking down at the girl.

“I have done what I must.  There was no better choice.”

The old woman sighed, and nodded sadly in agreement.  “No, what is coming cannot be stopped.  The world is changing.”

“I do not know if I will love her, when the new world comes,” the man said.

“Nor I,” the old woman agreed.  “But she will love us.  And she will make the world more than it is.  Perhaps that is enough.”

The man shrugged.  “Perhaps.”

“You should go, before the boy returns.  He is clever and swift, more than I would have thought.  He may have the seeds already.”

He looked down at the girl one more time, and knelt, cupping her face.  He looked back at the old woman.  “It is strange.  She has never spoken to me, and yet I will miss her.”

She smiled, “Children have that gift.” She placed a hand on his shoulder, and said “But please my friend, you must go.  Should the boy find you here, we risk much that we should not.  We must foster but not confirm suspicion.”

He nodded, and rose.  “Will I see you, or the sleeping child again?”

She shook her head, but smiled.  “Perhaps.  But not as we are now.”

He took the old woman’s hand and squeezed it gently.  “You sacrifice much; more, I think, than I would be willing.”

She did not reply, but pointed toward the cave mouth, and he assented and began to climb.

There was the tread of boots by the mouth of the cave, a foot that was not his and not the old woman’s.  It had not been there before, he was certain, and suddenly he was afraid.  Anyone could be wandering the hills, and there were no laws so far out here in the wilderness.  What if a highwayman had seen his torchlight from before, and descended into the cave, bent on robbery or murder?  The boy bent to pick up the stick, and pulled his tiny knife from his pack.  He struck his flint and lit the torch once more, and armed with fire and a glinting bit of steel, he carefully descended.  There were footsteps in the dirt, both coming and going, he could see them on the sand atop the stones.  Someone had been here and gone.  As quickly as he could, he made his way into the cave.

He drew near the pool, but there was only the old woman and his sister, much as he had left them.  The old woman was sitting with a hand in the water, soaking a cloth, the lantern casting a shadow of her very large against the wall.  As he approached, she turned to look at him.  “Did you find the seed?”

The boy did not answer, but looked about the room, continuing about the corners, looking into the shadows.  When he had satisfied himself, he returned.  “There was someone here.”

The old woman looked at him quizzically.  “There has been no one since you left.”

“I saw footprints in the sand.”

“Here, in the cave?”

He looked about to point and show her, but there were none about the two of them.  He walked back a few paces, and back a few more.  Nothing.  He could not find trace of them where they had been before.  He climbed back up the rocks, and looked where he had seen them, but there was nothing now.  No trace.  He was speechless.  They had been there only moments before.  He knew it, he had seen them.  And yet they were not there now, nothing but his own prints in the sand.  He returned to the woman, and looked at her dangerously.  “I do not know what you have done, but there were tracks here.  There was someone else.”

“Who, child?  Who could have found us so far out in the hills, who would have known where to look?”

The boy shrugged, frustrated, but could make no answer.  In the end he reached into his bag, and retrieved the tiny bundle.  “The seeds are in here.  The woman who gave them to me said they are poisonous though.  We must be careful.”

The old woman unwrapped the cloth, and looked at the seeds.  She nodded.  “The woman was right.  But it does not matter.  Your sister need neither drink nor eat of them.  It is enough that one is planted, by her side.”  She handed the bundle back to the boy.  “Take one from the pod, and dig a small hole.  Bury the seed, and then water it from the spring.”

The boy set down his pack, and he placed the bundle on the ground.  He cracked the husk open a little further, and dumped a few seeds onto the cloth.  He chose one among them, and went to his sister’s side.  He looked at her sleeping face, and though he was here, though he had found her, he did not have joy in his heart as he hoped.  He did not believe she would wake from planting a seed.  He did not know what the old woman was doing, or why.  There had been footprints, and she had turned hard and unfriendly to him on the road, and she had known the man who took his things, and had lied about the tinderbox.  He did not believe her anymore, that she was here only to help.  But he did not know what else to do.  And so he planted the seed, and buried it shallowly, and took cupped hands of water from the spring, to water it.  And when he had finished, he stood across from the woman, next to his sister and the planted seed.

“It is done,” he said.

“There is but one thing more,” the old woman said.  Her eyes had grown dark, and terrible in the lantern light.  She drew a knife, long and sharp, from her bag, and she turned to him.  “I am sorry, child.  I have studied her here while you were away.  Her life is forfeit.  Her soul is gone, but that she retrieve it with blood.  That of her own heart must water the seed, that it might birth her soul anew.  Without this, her soul as well as her life, will be taken.”

The boy could not move, or breathe.  That he had come so far for her to die, to be taken from him like this.  He looked upon his sister, and he began to cry.  He looked on her, and a thought came into his mind.  “No,” he said, tears on his face, sucking in breath.

“I’m sorry child.  There is no other way.”  She knelt near the girl, and raised her blade to strike.  The boy was very near, and he moved to kneel next to the woman, holding the hand of his sister.  He wept without restraint.  “I am so very sorry, child” the old woman said, and she plunged the knife toward the girl.

But the boy was very fast.  He had thrown himself between the knife and his sister, at the last moment, knowing that if he acted too soon, the woman would stop him.  It could be his blood, he decided, to water the seed.  The knife entered his chest, and the old woman cried out, and drew it back from him as quickly as she might.  Blood flowed.  It dripped down his body, and it soaked the ground, where the seed was buried.  The old woman dropped the knife and lifted the boy, and cradled him to her gently.  Tears were in her eyes, and she spoke very softly.  “You have done well, child.  You have done so very well.”  The boy’s eyes closed, and all was dark.
