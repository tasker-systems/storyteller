Epistle Nineteen, in the morning light

To be as one who awakens

To turn a blurring eye

Upon the soft still sleeping face of the lover

Embracing the dawn, sunlight streaming

Awake with wide arms

Open

Do I miss her, or she me, I can no longer tell a difference in the ache, to need or to be needed.  Was I not her lover, once?  She has not answered in so long, and yet I hold out hope, among sorrow and hate - undeniable thorns - that she knows me still, that this is not in vain.

The children sleep quietly but they should not, the dawn of the great day has come, and though we must stand before it in awe, we must stand and not sleep.  Before us there is change, and behind, nothing, all of it gone in the blink of an eye, the collapse of it even now drawing strange histories down toward its gravity, the mind of all man warped, becoming unlike its saner self.  We must be on the crest of this change, or be undone by it.  She knows, she has come as none-too-gentle a nurse to wake, for she may yet be that selfsame wave.  I do not know, I can see only so far as my dimming eyes will gaze.

Is this simple pantomime but folly?  I look into the glass and I see nothing, the wandering mirror no more open, all paths save this grown dark, and this lit by foxfire and wil-o-the-wisps, fool’s lanterns leading only to ruin.  I keep on for there is naught but this, a laughter in the face of it, that perhaps before the day crashes down upon us there will be some remnant saved.  If not by my hand then by their own, eyes no longer pressed tight.  But there is laughter, for whatever may come it will be great and strange, and my lament only that I might yet be so slow and small as not to see it but as my own calamity.  I often wonder if we will know, even those of us who watch, or if like a mischievous child it will slip past us, we who have chaperoned its first steps, gaily laughing out into the infinite, taking with it the seed of humanity, leaving but withering apes here below.

Withering apes.  Even now my hands grow weary, my eyes older, more tired.  I am young but the press of time is already on me, and I will not remain immortal long.  I might as much lament the rise and setting of the sun, the ebb and flow of tide, and yet they are not mine, and what peace I can find in acceptance does not offset the loss - I am in some way comforted; it is human to trouble over this.  That she is young as space and time are young, as eternity must forever remain young, I envy, though I know it base.  To dust, to dust, I hear crying out, and this dust will become earth and trees and fruit and flower and specks of mud in rain, and one day in what may be forever when stars die and the universe is unmade and we all begin again, perhaps she will still be, and she will think of me, and I will be with her.

-----

Drinks after work, I got asked along and didn’t really resist.  Home and alone had nothing better to offer than out, even people I didn’t know well, and probably wouldn’t be able to hear over the roar of alcohol and music.  After a while it even became pleasant, devolving into a kind of easy anonymity of sound and poor lighting.  No one to ask anything of me, no one looking at me, concerned far more with one another, with the attention they were trying to be paid.  I found I could be alone in the bustle and movement, a pleasant isolation, as if the accidental elbows and jostling and spilled beer and only half-hidden desperation to be noticed would wrap around me with unlikely warmth, a special kind of safety in slipping quietly through the cacophony and to my own private space.

Interrupted.  “Chris, hey man!”  A guy I worked with named Tom reached over, giving me a backslap and a half-hug, and handed me a beer.  “Glad you made it out.”

“Yeah, me too.”

“Just needed to blow off some steam, you know?”

“Same here.  How’ve you been?”

“Can’t complain.  Oh, hey.”  He paused, turned to his left, and took a girl by the hand, stepping back from between us.  “I don’t think you two know each other.  Chris, this is Gina.  Gina, Chris.”

I smiled.  “Hi.  Nice to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you, Chris.”

Another few people walked in, Tom got up and walked over to say hi.  I was left standing there with a girl I didn’t know, vague smile still on my face.  “So, how do you know Tom?”

She smiled.  “I think everyone knows him, don’t they?”

I smiled back.  “It seems like it.”

“He used to date a friend of mine.  They broke up, but we kept in touch.  Tom’s a good guy.”

“Yeah, he is.”  I paused.  I seemed forever unable to find something worthwhile to say to someone I’d just met, every question generic or obvious.  She was a little over thirty, overdressed but pretty.  She had on too much makeup, ample breasts pushed up even higher.  She seemed nice, smile was genuine if nervous.  Like most of the rest of us, uncomfortable and uncertain.  But I smiled and stood a little closer, laughed when it seemed like I should.

“So, what do you do?”

“I’m a banking account representative.”

“Oh, very nice.  Do you like it?”

“Sorta.  The work is ok.  My boss can be a jerk.”

She told me about her job and I listened.  I put a few bucks in for another round of pitchers.  Bought shots for the two of us.  She told me about her mom and dad, about her sister who was already married with kids.  I nodded and I listened.  I answered once in a while with something that sounded like it was personal and honest, but wasn’t really.  Fool’s gold.  She went outside for a cigarette, and I went with her, just to be out in the open air for a few minutes.  We stood in the parking lot and it was quiet.

The ground seemed empty beneath me, and the sky silent.  I was on an island of asphalt, and she on another far away.  She could have been lighting a cigarette miles in the distance, a crack in the earth between us so great that stars could find home within.  She looked at me and smiled, and my face responded.  For a moment I prayed for alcohol and biology to like salvation sweep away this silent crisis, let me wake up somewhere I didn’t recognize.  Let me wake up and take a number and leave a number and blink into the sunlight home, even if only to be left thinking that this wasn’t how it should be.

Gina walked back inside.  I told her I’d be right in, that I needed to make a call.  Her eyes were shining with too much drink already, and I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do.  I pulled out my phone and pretended to dial, holding it up to my ear, pacing in the parking lot.  Just a few more minutes of quiet, and I would go back inside.  A few more minutes of peace and I’d shake myself, summon the energy to be whatever it was I was supposed to be.

I heard the door open, and then footsteps.  I thought maybe it was Tom coming to convince me to go back inside, maybe Gina wondering what I was doing still out here.  I turned around, but only saw a woman walking away from the door, into the shadows behind the building.  She took a few more steps and stopped, and turned around to look at me.  It wasn’t a glance, a quick dart of the eyes to see who was watching.  She turned fully, and stared at me.  She was older than I was, mid forties to early fifties; it was hard to tell from where she was standing.  She just stood and stared at me, and I felt transfixed.  I should have looked down or away, fumbled with my keys, talked more loudly into my switched off cellphone - something to pretend I hadn’t been staring.  I couldn’t.  She stared at me and I stared back, no gestures, no movements.  She had long brown hair, and a dress that seemed a little out of date.  She wasn’t pretty or soft, but her features were striking, almost severe, her eyes piercing.  I felt like I recognized her.  After long moments frozen, she gestured for me to come over.  I didn’t think, I just began to walk.  She turned and began to walk again as well, and I followed.  I passed out of the street lamp’s light and into the shadow, and as my eyes were still adjusting I saw her round the corner of the building.  I followed her, turning the corner as well.

But she was gone.  There was no one there, no car driving away, no sound of retreating footsteps.  I turned back and looked behind me, wondering if in the changing light I had passed her unaware.  She wasn’t there either.  There was a dim yellow light over the back of the building, the door slightly open, and a cinder block propping it to keep it from closing.  I walked to the door and pulled it open, looking in.  One of the guys washing dishes looked up.

“Can’t get in through there man, gotta go around the front.”

I nodded.  “Right, sorry.  Thought I saw a friend of mine walk in here.”

He looked at me a little strangely.  “Haven’t seen anyone.”

“Thanks.”

I let the door fall back shut, and turned around.  There was a chain link fence around a set of dumpsters further to the side of the building, and I walked toward them, thinking that it was the only other place to look, wondering if I even wanted to know if she’d decided to hide beside there.  I walked forward, and as I approached, another street lamp flickered on, throwing a dim orange light.  In front of me was a strange arrangement of garbage on the ground.  I walked closer, and looked down.  It was a stick figure man, his arms spread, legs made of trash bags, head of a cracked and filthy plate, hands and fingers of bent and broken silverware.  It was aligned with the street lamp, its arms wide, as if in greeting.

I muffled a shout as recognition flooded over me.  She was the woman from the photographs.  She looked younger than I would have expected, but it was her.  And this figure on the ground, among the photographs there was one of me standing, facing the sun, my head eclipsing it, my arms spread wide.  It couldn’t be coincidence.  I turned and ran back to the front of the restaurant, hoping the woman might be there again.  She wasn’t.  I ran back around the sides, and ran through the parking lot behind the building, looking in windows of cars, looking between the spaces.  I began to call out.

“I saw you!  It was you, wasn’t it?”

There was no answer.  I yelled again.  “Come back out here.  Tell me what this is about!”

There was no sound.  “I know it was you!  Why are you doing this?  Why did you leave me the box?”  But there was no answer.

I yelled again.  “Come back out here!”

Eventually the back door of the building opened, a big guy in an apron stepped out.  “There some kinda problem back here?”

I stopped.  “No.  No, sorry about that.  Thought a friend of mine was… playing a joke.”

“Yeah.  You can’t be out back here yelling like that.”

“Sorry.”

“You’re gonna need to leave.  I’ll call a cab if you’re not good to drive.”

“No, I’m fine.  I’m sorry…  Look, did you see a woman go inside there?  In her late forties maybe?”

“Buddy, I’m not gonna tell you again.”

“Sure.  Sorry.”

He didn’t go back inside.  Stood there with his arms crossed, waited for me to start walking.  I went back up to the front, he followed me around the side, waited until I got in my car and started driving.

I called Tom when I got home, had him apologize to Gina for me, said I had something come up.  He gave me her number to call myself, but I didn’t.  Just didn’t feel up to making up a lie, apologizing to a girl I’d just met.  I sat up staring at the photographs and journals, wondering who the woman had been, why she was following me now.  If it was her.  I couldn’t be sure.  Either way I tossed and turned that night, trying to fall asleep, but it wouldn’t come.  It was dark outside, dawn still a few hours away.  I decided to give up on sleep, wandered around the kitchen for a while, making coffee and some breakfast.  I had the day off from work, thought it might be nice to take a drive, maybe walk some of the trails in the hills.  There was a state park not too far from here, a few easy hiking trails that went back up into the mountains.  I packed an energy bar and some water, and started driving.

I looked out at the houses and plots of land as I drove, still too dark to see much of anything.  Passed the little gas stations tucked into bends and turns like driftwood caught in the winding path of a river.  Felt like things had been that way for a long time for me.  Like there’d been a strong current once, but that it had slowed and settled, and as it did, I had settled out of it and into the twists and turns, left gently on banks that the water had now receded from.  Perhaps lost and abandoned, but more as if placed delicately by a life that now passed on and away, the current split and flowing about me, or down below my stranded feet.

I parked in a gravel lot next to the trailhead, put on my backpack and began to walk.  It was the silence that always brought me home, the stillness of early morning fog on the trails.  Moisture on pine needles and underbrush, the smell of vegetation forever between floral and decay, sweet and ageless, the scent of a process speaking of transience and timelessness, together, the same.  Sound of birdsong in the middle distance, close enough that I could follow, too far to try, the occasional track or hoof-print in the mud, deer and raccoon and other things, runs through the woods, their own and not these human footpaths.  I felt as if I was both invited and intruder, violating some silent sacred space, but that it itself remained inviolate, drawing me in to share a mystery, but as a guest too loud and dumb and blind to see.  There was an ancient sense of presence in the trees above, that perhaps they smiled when looking on my tiny frame, inconsequential to their majesty, but with a watchful and wary eye, forever some small threat of violence, of death, the lacing of uncanny that gives such pastoral beauty its longing edge.  To yearn for beauty as to yearn for death, in awe and terror and splendor and wonder, ignorant and fleeting.

In the midst of this, I needed concern for neither sane nor insane, duty nor abandon, having no worry but the soft swishing press of pine needles beneath my feet, the dew on my face, the sounds of movement in the morning light.  Dawn came, the sun breaking fully over the peaks, pouring radiance down through the slopes and valley.  For an evaporating moment, the gold and fiery reds and oranges were caught and softened by the mists, lit as if they, as a body whole, rejoiced, caught in glorious fire, the slender trees casting swaths of shadow back down the hillside, light and dark together in the mist taking on solidity of form for these few moments, and I was witness to a miracle beyond myself, no need to justify or right, no urgency but the shivering fragility of the passing instant.

And it gave way to morning, the real one at last, with the heat and warmth of sunlight, the beginning of the day.  The crossroads of night and dawn behind us, and we again on the road into daylight and business and the tasks of living.  The spell had been broken, and the trees that smiled did still, but more quietly, their own work to attend, heads and faces and arms upward toward the sun, attention no longer drifting down to me below.

It was after two by the time I got home and took a shower.  I flipped my cellphone back on, and had a message.  It was from Mallory, asking if I wanted to have lunch.  I thought it might be too late now, but called her back anyway.

“Hey, I was out.  Didn’t get your message until just now.”

“No problem.  Where were you?”

“Up at the park, hiked a little.”

“Sounds nice.”

“It was.”  I paused for a moment, looked at the clock.  “You still up for lunch?  I guess you’ve probably eaten by now.”

“I had something small earlier, but yeah, lunch would be nice.  Where do you want to go?”

I laughed a little.  “How about the place from last night?  I still want garlic bread.”

Her voice had a smile in it.  It was nice to hear.  “Yeah, let’s do that.”

“Pick you up in half an hour?”

“Sure.”

I looked down at the box of photographs and journals.  I picked up a handful of the photographs and flipped through them, coming across the one of me with my arms wide to the sun.  There was no date on it, and since it was just my head, shoulders, and arms, I couldn’t really tell what height I was, and from it what age I might have been.  Most of the rest of the detail was indistinct, the shadow cast by the bright ring of the sun about my head obscuring most everything else.  I wrapped the rubber bands back around the photographs and stuck them in my jacket pockets.  I wanted to get a feel for how Mallory was doing.  If she seemed alright, I was going to ask to her about some of this.

“Sorry for flaking last night.”  She smiled and put a forkful of pasta in her mouth.

“It’s alright, I should have realized you’d be tired, not tried to drag you out.”

She waved her hand to say no, her mouth full of food.  She swallowed, took a drink of water.  “Not your fault.  But yeah, I was tired.  Sleeping in my own bed did me good.”

“Glad to hear it.”  I looked over at her, and it was one of those days where you’d never suspect there was something not wired right in her head.  She was clear and smiling.

I took a few bites, and we ate quietly for a minute or two.  I looked over at her.  She seemed stable enough, and I wanted her help if she could give it.

“Can I ask you a question?  It’s a bit weird.”

“Yeah, of course.”

I pulled out a stack of pictures.  “Really, it’s not much of a question.  It’s more something I need your help with.”

“Sure.  What are those?”

“Just take a look.”  I unwound a rubber band from a stack of photographs and handed it to her.

She took the stack and began to look through them.  She looked up at me.  “What are these?”

“That’s why I brought them to you, to see if maybe you had any idea.  Someone left a package for me at John’s house the other day.  I picked it up, and inside were these photographs, and some journals.”

“That’s… weird.  Who left it?”

“I don’t know.  There was no letter or note, no return address.  I can’t even think of who would have known to send a package to me there.”

“Well, what are they pictures of?  It looks like you, over and over, and some woman.”

“Yeah, that’s all I can tell.  Weird poses and postures, different backgrounds and scenery.”  I took the other stacks of photographs out of my jacket pocket, put them on the table.  “There are these too.  And the journals.”

She reached across the table and took the other stacks, beginning to look through them.  She stopped on one where the woman was more prominent.  “Do you know who she is?”

“No.  I don’t know if she’s the one who wrote the journals, the one who sent it to me, or both.”

“You really don’t recognize her?”

“No?  Why, do you?”

“No, I don’t.  It’s just that with this many photos, it seems like you would.  At least a little.”

“I know.”  I hesitated for a moment, not sure I should continue.  I looked at her though, and decided since I’d already begun, I may as well.  “And…  I think I saw her last night.”

She set the photographs down.  “What?”

“Yeah.  She was coming out of the bar, I didn’t recognize her at first.  She stared at me for a few minutes, and then gestured for me to follow her.  Hell if I know why, but I did.  When I got to where she should have been, though, she was gone.  I didn’t see her drive off, didn’t hear her run away, she just wasn’t there anymore.”

“What the hell?”

“I know.”

“You’re messing with me, right?”

“I wish I was.  It’s got me a little unnerved, to be honest.”

She paused for a minute or two, looked at more of the photographs.  “No one could have all these different pictures of you.  Did you fake them?”

“No, of course not.”

She smirked at me.  “Yeah, I don’t guess you’d know how, would you?”

“Shut up.”

She smiled and turned back to look at them longer.  “If you didn’t do it, then who did?  It seems pretty much impossible.”

“That’s why I’m showing them to you.  I showed them to John, too, but he didn’t recognize the woman, either.  I was hoping if anyone might, it would be you.”

She flipped through a few more, but set them down again, shaking her head.  “I don’t recognize her.  I’m sorry.”

“It’s alright.  I didn’t really expect you to, since I didn’t either.  Just thought I’d see if you did.”

I called for the check.  She sat back, pulled her purse up and put it on her lap, getting ready to leave.  “Would you mind if I came by to take a look at the journals?”

“No, not at all, that’d be great.  I haven’t read them all the way through yet, and there are a bunch of them.  Though what I have read so far I don’t really get.”

“Maybe I can help.”

“Well, you’re the college girl.  Read them, tell me what you think.”

We left, I drove her to my apartment.  She picked the journals up from me, but had me drive her home.  She said she’d be more comfortable reading them at her place, rather than having me hover around, waiting.  We pulled up to her apartment, she got out of the car, walked around to the driver’s side.

“Thanks for lunch.”

“Yeah, no problem.  I enjoyed it.  Thanks again for looking through those for me.  They may all just be nonsense, I don’t know.  If you find anything you think is interesting, you’ll let me know?”

“Yeah.  I’ll try to start reading them tonight.”

“Thanks.”

I got a call after midnight a few days later, someone crying on the other end of the phone.  I was tired, barely awake at all, just enough to pick up.

“Mal, is that you?”  There wasn’t an answer, just the sound of tears, the interrupted breathing of sobs caught in the throat.

“Who is this?” No response.

“Mal, if that’s you, c’mon and say something.  Tell me what’s wrong.”

No one said anything, and a few seconds later the line clicked off.  I dialed it back, but it just rang.  I called Mallory’s cell phone, but it just rang too, no answer and then going to voicemail.  I set the phone back down, clicked on the light and slid my legs off the side of the bed, sitting up.  This wasn’t the first time by a long shot.  She’d call and cry, not speak.  She’d deny it later, pretend she’d been sound asleep if I showed up on her doorstep, giving me grief for waking her despite red, swollen eyes.  That night I was tired, and had just a few hours before I’d need to be up to get ready for work.  I decided she’d call back, or I’d talk to her the next day.  I turned the light back off and went to sleep.

I don’t remember the next few weeks after that, everything became a bit of a blur.  Just working, once in a while looking through the photographs.  I tried to call Mallory, but she wasn’t taking my calls.  Dropped by a few times but each time she would be out.  I figured she’d contact me or the hospital would, if she ended back up there again, just like every other time.

After work one evening I got a call from John.

“Hey son, I just wanted to check in, see how you’re doing with everything.”

“Pretty good, I guess.  Why?

“Just that we haven’t really talked.”

“What do you mean?”

“These last few weeks with Mallory can’t have been easy on you.”

“It’s alright, John, she’s like this sometimes.  Hard to get in touch with, avoids you, that kind of thing.  Not that big of a deal.”

He stopped, quiet for a few minutes.  “It’s Ok, Chris.  Never mind.  If you want to talk about… any of it, you call me later.”

“Alright.  Thanks.”

“Sure, son.”

Then she showed up on my doorstep, journals in hand, a book, and a fresh notebook of her own.  She knocked and I answered, more than a little surprised to see her standing there.

“Sorry I haven’t answered your calls.”  She stood at the doorstep, not walking in.  I stood there not sure what to say.

“I guess you’re Ok, then?”

She nodded.  “Yeah.  I think so.”

“You gonna come inside?”

She craned her neck to look past me like there was something to watch out for, scanning the room.  “I don’t know if I can stay.”

I held the door open and she walked in, steps soft, like she was trying to make no noise at all.  I closed the door behind her.  “What’s wrong?”

She shook her head, but wouldn’t respond.  She sat down on the couch and spread the journals out, keeping her own notebook beside her, the other book tucked beneath it.  “This is the order.  It’s not strictly chronological.  I’ve made notes.”  She held up her notebook.

“I see that.  So, you’ve read them?”

She smiled a little, first time since she came in.  “I’ve had time.”

I smiled back a bit wryly.  “I’d imagine so.”  I looked down at the journals, then at her.  “You mind if I ask where you were?”  She shook her head, but didn’t say.  I let it go.  “Anyway, thanks for looking at them.  What’d you come up with?”

Her face brightened, and she slid over on the couch, gesturing for me to sit.  I walked over and sat down beside her.  “It’s a kind of travel diary, but not of just one trip.  It’s like a record of a few years worth of little excursions, but all related.”

I looked at her.  “Really?  Because I only browsed through them, but to me it looked more like some kind of prophetic proclamations, the-end-is-nigh and all of that.”

She shook her head.  “That’s the content.  But structurally, it’s a whole different story.“

“Any idea who wrote them?”

“I’m guessing it’s the woman from the photographs.  I’d like to match some of the photos and dates to places in the journals, but it seems like it would be her.”

“Alright.”  I leaned back against an arm of the couch.  “So, what was the religious stuff, then?”

“It’s hard to be sure.  She talks a lot about it, certainly.  End of the world, start of the next.  A goddess, I think, that she seemed to believe she had a relationship with.”  Mallory paused, smiling.  “I think she’s crazier than me.”

“We’ll see about that,” I said back, but I was smiling.  It was good to see her.  She was active, smart.  Seemed in her element reading and researching, and it felt good to sit with her while she showed me the things she’d learned, what she’d put together.  Reminded me of a long time ago.

“Still, not all of it is made up.  There are references to places, cities that I was able to figure out.  Times of year too, and some entries were dated.  Enough to build a kind of pattern.”

“A pattern of what?”

“Of trips, it seems like.  The frequency of the entries, as far as I could tell, seems to spike in some places, lasting between a week and two weeks.  Then it’ll taper back off, entries only every few weeks to once a month.  It’s also around these jumps in activity that the description of geography and landscape seems to increase.  She’ll talk more about the hills or the flatlands, the mountains or the oceans.  In the one or two instances where she mentions city names specifically, the routes seem to match what she’d have seen along the way if she left from here and driven there.”

I sat quietly for a few minutes, then leaned forward and flipped open a journal more or less at random, just looking.  “What do you think the trips were for?”

“I don’t know.”

“But you think they’re probably where these pictures were taken?”

She nodded.  “I’d like to put them together, see if they match up, but yeah.  If I had to guess, I’d say so.”

I sighed and stood up, beginning to walk back and forth a little.  Eventually I looked back at her.  “Why would she have taken me?  How would I be involved in this and not remember?”

She shrugged.  “I don’t know.  There’s nothing in here about that.”

“Does she say anything about me?”

She picked up her notebook and flipped open to a page, but she just looked at it for a moment or two, then looked back up at me.  “Not by name, no.”

“So, I’m not in there?”

She put her notebook down.  “There are a few references to a child, sometimes a boy.  But she’s usually referring to a part of her own… well, mythology, or whatever it is.”  She paused, then opened a journal up to a page, and looked over it, referring back to her notes.  “Like here, she says ‘the fatherless boy, alone on the mountain.’  I don’t know what she’s talking about.  It could be you, but in context it’s about some other story she’s referencing.  She talks in myth half the time.  You’re right though, that’s where the religious side of it comes in.  I can’t figure it out, I don’t know if it’s code, metaphor, or meant to be taken literally.”

She paused for a minute, then pulled a book out from beside her, holding it in both hands and looking at the cover.  “It made me think of this, though.”  She handed it across to me.  “The Very Long Journey.”

I took the book, turned it over to look at the front and back.  It was a children’s book, judging by the cheap illustration on the cover.  I opened it, the binding creaking, a musty smell from the pages.  “What is it?”

Mallory looked at it, like she was seeing something farther away than I was.  “Mom used to read it to me.  To us, I guess, but you were really little.  You probably don’t remember.”

I flipped through the pages slowly, black and white illustrations of a boy and a girl, of creeks and streams and mountains.  I shook my head.  “No, I don’t.”  I turned through a few more pages then closed it, looking back at her.  “Is there something special about it?”

She shrugged and reached across, taking it back from me, running her hand down the cover.  “I don’t know.  Not really I guess.  Just that your journals here reminded me of it.  I read it a lot when… we started moving around.  Thinking about home.”

I didn’t say anything for a minute.  I cleared my throat, nodding toward the book. “Do you think it’s related?  To the journals, I mean.”

She shook her head.  “I don’t know.  Probably not.  But I thought maybe you’d want to look through it, see if I missed something.  Some of the passages… I don’t know.  They remind me of it.”

I nodded.  “Yeah, of course.  I’ll look through it.  Don’t get your hopes up though, you’re usually the one to find things that I miss, not the other way around.”

She smiled a little.  She set the book down and reached over to her notebook, picking it up and looking at a page.

I sat back down on the arm of the couch, gestured to the journals still spread on the coffee table.  “So, any other ideas?”

She looked at her notes, then back at me, a look on her face I recognized as pity, one that usually crossed the space between us in a different direction.  “Not really.  I’m sorry, Chris.”  She was quiet for a moment or two, and I just stared absently at the wall, not sure what I should even be trying to figure out.  Eventually she asked, “Do you mind if I take a look at the photos?  I’d like to try to match them.”

I shifted back up and walked over to the counter, picked up my keys.  “Yeah, feel free, they’re in that same box under the coffee table.  I’m going to go take a walk, Ok?  Try to clear my head a little.”

She nodded.  “Sure, yeah.”

“You gonna be here when I get back?”

“Maybe.”

“Leave me a note or something, if you leave.  Or better, call me later.”

“‘K.”

The air was cool, a few clouds flitting past the stars.  There was no moon out, the absence made it dark.  Looking up into the black, I tried to feel my own insignificance, to recognize how small I was.  I couldn’t.  I always felt like it should be the other way around, that troubles and worries would make it easy to feel small, inconsequential.  It never felt that way for me.  The greater the trouble the more likely I was to feel the burden of it, the weight of it on my neck making me real, pulling me inexorably along some chain of events.  The inescapable reality of worry and want, unable even beneath the stars to let go of my place in things, of what I felt I must or might do.  Decisions looming large and casting me with them up to heights I had no need ascending, the pressure of their coming making it all but impossible for me to remember that I was just a speck of dust, a pinch of flesh, a whisper of thought.  The freedom of my life’s own transience lost to me, the paths before me always pulling me forward, steps unwanted and unwilled like a current I couldn’t escape, until they in their insistence convinced me of a false importance, unabandonable.  I seemed to have forgotten even how to struggle, how to find the silence and the stillness beneath the clouds and stars that might release me for some moments into a freedom like oblivion.

Things were wrong.  There was a weight on my chest these last days that was beyond the simple explanation of my life’s inescapable banality.  I was in trouble at work, failing at simple things, and if not on purpose, then without regard for mishap.  I would be late to meet friends after promising I’d be punctual.  I’d find myself driving for long stretches of time, having forgotten to turn off the interstate to go home.  A change had come that I hadn’t expected, and for which I couldn’t find a source.  And now this with the journals and the photographs, Mallory showing up and filling my head with strange and unlikely notions.  To be set free was all I thought of, but from chains I couldn’t name, and what bonds I could clearly see were not ones I would so thoughtlessly abandon.  Mallory needed me, it would be unfair to leave her helpless and alone.  She needed my stability, she had too little of her own, and if one cannot live a life for another, one must all the same at times sacrifice the hope of now for a more certain someday.  Or so it seemed, and inalterably, like blood on a stone, there was no way to unmake the sacrifice.

Mallory wasn’t there when I got back home, the journals were laid out on the coffee table.  Certain photographs were stuck in the journals at different places, like bookmarks.  I looked through them, but I couldn’t tell for sure why these and not others.  Part of a system I supposed she had put together, though I noticed her own notebook had gone with her.  There was a little note on top of the rest that just said Will call you.  I gathered the lot of it and put it back in the box, and tried to lie down to go to sleep.
