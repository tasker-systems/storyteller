Epistle Twenty, to hear the rushing of it in your ears.

A falcon rises in the east.  The brother of the serpent has died, though not as of old from such sting.  The dying god has succumbed to age, the child now in his stead.

An aeon passes.  Symbols become broken, distorted, as new rise in their place, the very names of the gods no longer fit, calling to memories of what once was, but no more is.  They are not gone from us.  They are only new, their forms and affects of a changing and changed world, hearkening not to a history no longer lived.  History.  It is from such an age we come and into another we pass on, that the very space of possible for such chronology of acts will be shaken, cracked, its parts separated into something incomprehensible and stranger still.

But you do not need to know this.  You hear only the wind and the cry of the falcon looking down, and it knows you.  It has loved you as I have, as she has.  Your path is treacherous; do not stumble.  Turn your ear to the whisper and the roar of it coming off the mountain, and when you have need call out.  The wind will hear.

“We should just go home, Chris.”

“No.”

“Please.  Something’s wrong.  You aren’t thinking clearly.”

“You can go home if you want to, I’ll give you money for a bus back.”

“That’s not fair.”

“I’m sorry, but I won’t stop now.  Not now that I’ve started to remember something.”

She was holding the note from Henri, the key still taped to it.  I’d looked up directions to the address on the computer in the lobby, the printout was next to her on the bed.  I’d explained, she’d argued.  The more sense she made, the more resolute I felt.  More certain of my way forward, like unwittingly her resistance was acting as a wall against which I could press to launch the other direction.

“You don’t know if any of it’s real.”

“What about that note?  That’s got to mean something.”

“Like what?  You don’t know what this key is to.  It seems dangerous, Chris.  It scares me.”

“I’m sorry.  You may be right, it might be safer if you don’t go.”

“That’s not what I meant.”

“I know.”

“What are you trying to prove, exactly?  What do you gain by going?”

“Nothing, maybe.”  I paused, took a breath.  “There’s just something I have to figure out.”

“Like what?”

“I don’t know yet.  Something about the goddess in the journals.  Why there are pictures of me.  Why I can’t remember it.”

“It’s insane.  This is totally divorced from reality.”

“Maybe.”  I didn’t have a good answer.  “I think it may have been from the start.  I don’t know if it matters anymore.”

“Do you really think it’s alright for you to start believing in all of this now?”

“Is that so bad?  That I want to believe in something?”

“When it’s something like this?  Yeah.  It is bad.  It’s crazy.  I know a thing or two about that, remember?”

“I’m not crazy.”

“How would you know?”

She stopped, almost breathless, and I didn’t have anything to say back in my defense.  I just waited for a minute, then picked up my bag and began to stuff the last few things back in it.  “I’m going to put this in the car.  We need to be checked out in about twenty minutes.  I’d really rather you come with me.  If you won’t, I’ll drive you to the bus station.”

I picked up my bag and walked out the door.

She met me outside about fifteen minutes later, put her bags in the car and got in.  She didn’t speak to me, wouldn’t respond when I spoke to her.  I let her silence be close enough to acceptance.  I checked us out of the room and we got back on the road.  We drove and we didn’t speak.  We drove until the flatness of Louisiana became the rockiness of Arkansas, until we’d left swamp for foothills.  It was early afternoon, I pulled into a rest area and parked, turned the car off.  I didn’t move to get out though, sat still for a moment, then picked up the printed maps, looking at them.

“We’re not going to make it there before it gets dark.”

Mallory shrugged.  “Ok.”

“There’s a state park near here.  Supposed to be pretty, I looked it up while I printed out the directions to the cabin.  Waterfalls and little caves in the hills and trees.”

She looked over at me, but didn’t respond.

“I was thinking… I don’t know.  We’ve stayed in hotels every night so far.  It might be nice to camp instead.  They have cabins, too, if it looks like the camp sites aren’t worth trying.”

“Camping?  Really?”

“Maybe, yeah.  It might be nice to be out under the stars.  Go for a hike in the morning or something.”

“Sleeping on the ground, without shelter, would be better than a hotel how, exactly?”

“Well, we have a tent.  I packed one.”

She paused, crossed between angry and amused.  “You packed a tent?”

“I didn’t think we’d get a chance to use it.  I packed it just in case.”  I paused.  “What do you think?”

She didn’t answer for a minute.  She looked out the window, and when she looked back at me, her face was softer.  “Why not.  It might be nice.”

“Really?”

“Sure.  We’re eating at a real restaurant though.  We’re not buying propane and trying to cook something, or rely on your ability to start a campfire.”

“No, definitely not.  I’d burn down the tent.”

She laughed a little.  It seemed like she was forcing it to be more of a laugh than she felt, but I appreciated it.  “True.”

I laughed too, more than I felt.

“Did you pack sleeping bags?”

“No.  But we can find somewhere to buy some when we stop to eat.”

“Why pack a tent but no sleeping bags?”

“I didn’t think I could fit two sleeping bags in the car without you noticing.  The tent fit under the rest of my stuff.”

She just laughed.

We got the tent set up at the campground, then left for dinner.  It passed without incident.  We talked a little, neither of us pressing the other too hard, not trying to make conversation where there wasn’t any.  I didn’t drink anything, the last two nights had been enough for me, but Mallory had a few glasses of wine.  Enough at least that by the time we’d picked up sleeping bags and the novelty of the idea had mostly worn off for her, she was too tired to really care.  We made it to the tent, scrambled around with a weak flashlight, pulled the sleeping bags out of the packaging, and went to sleep.  Or she did.  I tried, I was comfortable and it was quiet, and even more than in a hotel room I was relaxed.  But I felt awake, alert out in the woods.  I could hear the sound of nocturnal things, raccoons and possums and armadillos, scurrying around among the trees, scavenging, hoping that we’d left junk food or garbage somewhere within reach.  There was a breeze blowing, not hard but consistent, enough to make the side of the tent flap slowly.

I tried not to stay awake, tried to think about being tired, about needing rest.  But it wouldn’t come.  I thought about Henri’s key, and what we were headed toward.  I played the words of his note over in my head, but I didn’t understand it any better.  And in the dark and quiet I couldn’t help but wonder if Mallory was right, if I my reasoning was becoming dangerous.  If I was believing something that was playing to some broken part of me I couldn’t see.  She hadn’t tried to talk me out of thinking it was real, just from acting on the belief, trying to protect me where my reason might be failing.  I turned to my side, then to the other, unable to sleep.  I slipped my boots back on and unzipped the tent.  Mallory mumbled in her sleep a little as I did it, but rolled over and didn’t seem to wake.  I zipped it back and walked to the picnic table near the clearing just before the valley.

The moon was bright, I could see it reflected in the river below.  The breeze carried the sound of it up to me.  Like when I was a kid I could almost hear words in the breeze, the glossolalia of the mad wind, always murmuring and whispering things that only it can know, its syllables caught unheeded in my foolish ears.  It grew stronger, the trees began to sway, the branches as if in choral accompaniment.  I began to smile without reason, my face upturned to the night sky and the whipping wind.  I could hear it shaking the tent, but Mallory didn’t emerge.  My smile became laughter as it roared harder, the branches exultant, the wind seeming from nowhere.  I laughed and laughed, standing with my arms out, my face as if my nose could become the prow of this my strange flying vessel, splitting these unexpected waves.

I laughed and I began to call out strange things, words I did not know I knew, saying sounds into the night that had no meaning to me.  I did not think but laugh, I did not try to calm my fluttering spirit, I spoke my own tongue of nonsense into the sky.  I called out to the goddess in a language I did not know and that may not have been and would by the morning have utterly faded.  And yet in that moment I felt as if I conversed, I laughed and spoke and there was response in the trees and the flap of the tent and the roar of the wind up the slope of the valley.  There were clouds but not many, only enough to roll past with these strange gusts, and the moon silver haloed shone down through.  Venus crossed her path nearby, and I laughed and I spoke my wonder and my joy and though Mallory may have believed nothing and though I knew not if I believed myself, in this moment I was worshiper and worshipped, I was a priest to a goddess that loved me if never before then wholly now.  I laughed and I shouted and the wind roared and the trees thrashed and there was a knife edge of cool in it and it was love.

And then it slowed, and stilled.  My eyes were tearing and glassy, my face stinging with the thrill of it.  My laughter was quiet in return, but not silenced, only slowed in kind.  I walked back and I sat on the table and I lay atop it and looked at the trees against the sky, still trembling among the highest branches.  I watched for a long time as the moon sank lower toward the trees on the ridge, casting twisting shadow shapes among the straight and lofty pines, in silhouette as it descended down behind.  When I could no more hold my eyes open I crawled back into the tent and fell deeply and soundly asleep.

I felt rested the next morning, like I hadn’t in a long time.  I was up early, well before Mallory stirred.  I tromped about among the trees nearest the camp site, climbing down a little way into the valley, though not far as my footing wouldn’t hold.  I felt pleasantly hungry, in want of coffee, with an appetite that extended beyond food or drink, but felt like a hunger for something out of the ground, a hunger for something in the air.  I smiled such that I began to feel embarrassed at my own enthusiasm.  I heard the sounds of stirring back at the site and I returned, seeing Mallory emerge from the tent, her hair tangled, eyes bleary.  She smiled though, without frustration or malice.

I waved at her as I pushed back through the brush.  “Sleep well?”

She looked around slowly, up at the trees and to the mist rising from the valley.  “I did.  This is pretty nice to wake up to.”

“It is, isn’t it?”

She nodded, rubbed at her face.  “No showers though, I guess.”  She leaned back into the tent and pulled her bag out, got a bottle of water.  “I’m gonna go brush my teeth.”  She took a few steps toward the bathrooms down the trail a bit, then looked back at me.  “Oh.  Were you talking to someone last night?  I woke up for a minute, I thought I heard you.”

I smiled.  “Just the wind.”

“Yeah, it was pretty loud.”  She turned and kept walking.

We packed everything back in, found a place in town for breakfast and coffee, and were back on the road.  About two and a half hours to find the place, some of the roads back in the hills weren’t labeled clearly, others not at all.  We had to stop and ask for directions more than once, even with the maps, but we found it.  A little cabin on the side of a mountain, shutters closed, door locked, no cars, no one anywhere nearby.  We walked around the cabin once, but there was only the structure and the line of trees, the road back out and nothing else.  I walked up the little stone steps and knocked, waited, and knocked again.  No one answered.

I turned, looked at Mallory.  “Guess no one’s home.”

“Probably why he gave you a key.”

I shrugged.  “We’re here.  May as well take a look.”  I took they key from my pocket and slid it in the lock, pushing open the door.

It was dark inside, we opened the windows, threw back the shutters.  The inside was no more assuming than the out, a simple cabin, the only room with a door was the bathroom.  Kitchen, living room, and bedroom were all in the one open space, divisions only of function and not of walls.  But while the space was simple, taking it in was not.  On the walls there were maps with colored tacks, photographs of me both as a child and an adult pinned about them.  There was a rough-hewn table and on it were spread other journals like the ones we had, pictures of other children stacked in piles.  There were many, but none so numerous as the photographs of me.  Illustrations had been torn from books, taped or pinned to the wall or taped to other photographs, hand-written scraps throughout, annotating or explicating some obscure connection.

“Oh my god.”  Mallory said it first, before I could find the words.

We both walked to the table, to the walls and began pouring over what was there.  There were too many pinpoints on the maps.  Far more than we had considered from our readings of the journals.  More than I could have possibly participated in.  There were photographs of people I’d never seen next to pictures of me, children with lines drawn to me as an child, adults drawn in red string or lines of marker to me as an adult.  In the same manic hand of the journals we had originally been given, there were fragments of poetry or prophecy scrawled below and connected too with string or marker to other places on the map.

“This is impossible.”  Mallory stepped away from the table, shaking her head.

I barely spoke.  “I know.”

This did not feel like vindication.  This was some disturbed dream.

“You know who this cabin has to belong to.”

“How is this possible?  Where would she have gotten these pictures of me, Mal?  Who are these other people?”

She shook her head.  “I need to go outside.”

I followed her, my head spinning.  She sat down on the steps.  I stood leaning against the railing, unable to make sense of it.  “Why would a mechanic in Louisiana have a key to this?”

“I don’t know, Chris.”

“He would have had to have known who I was.  He would have had to have known her, too.  I can’t… I can’t wrap my head around that.  It’s not just something that happened when I was a kid, was it?  There are pictures of me in there from less than a year ago.  A year ago!  And the others in the photographs… there must have been a dozen of them.”

She didn’t answer.  I looked down, she was breathing strangely.  I put my hand on her shoulder, she looked up, her face shaken.  It took her a minute to speak.  “I know one of the girls in the other photographs.”

“What?”

She stood up, took a deep breath.  She walked back inside, I followed her.  She picked up a stack of photographs on the desk, took the top one, pointed to the girl in the picture.  “Her.  Her name is Stephanie.  She’s a nurse at the hospital.  I only met her a few times, but she was nice to me.  Friendly.”  She paused, took a deep breath.

“What is it?”

“When I started, y’know, prophesying or whatever?  Not in the graveyard, but before, in the hospital.”

“Yeah.”

“She was there.  Everyone else just acted like it was pretty normal, a psych patient talking for god or to god doesn’t really stand out.  But she was different.  When I finally came down, over the next few days she tried to talk to me about it, ask me what I meant by some of it.  Asked me if I’d heard it before, if I was quoting or something.  She got really intense, almost angry, like she was afraid of something.  When I couldn’t think of where it came from, she got really upset.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know.  I don’t think she worked again before I got out, at least I didn’t see her again.”

“I guess I meant why would there be a photograph of her here?  Why would she be connected to this?”

“How should I know?”

“It’s just that this is an impossible coincidence.”

She nodded, but didn’t answer.

Eventually we went back inside, looked through photographs and at maps on the walls.  Things began to unravel, fit even less than they had before.  Some of the journals were obvious drafts of the ones we were given.  Similar dates, descriptions, bits of prophecy reworded and scratched out and written again.  Phraseology was different in some, the focus different as the creation took shape.  The journals we had received were obviously the products of planning and revision, honed to tell something specific, and not the product of a mad inspiration as their structure seemed intent on implying.

Artifice.  I could no better judge the sincerity of it than a forged painting.  But there was no profit in it that I could see.  I wasn’t rich or powerful, and not brilliant enough to help with any cause, even compelled, tricked, or manipulated.  And though it seemed like the journals were artifacts constructed with some singular goal, the photographs of both myself and the others didn’t seem to be, to my untrained eye, falsified.  The photographs we had been sent seemed legitimate, and my memory of the day in the swamp was, if fabricated of my own imagination, startlingly real.  After some hours of reading, comparing, and making notes, we were both too tired to continue.  The afternoon sun was beginning to go down, and the light through the windows was becoming dim.  We pulled the two chairs to the porch and sat, silently, each thinking and tired of thinking.

Mallory sighed and laughed a little.  “I can’t even tell how we’re being played.”

I laughed softly, pushed my chair back on two legs, balancing against the wall.  “I know.”  I paused, then looked over at her.  “You mind if I call the hospital later, see if maybe we can get in touch with that girl Stephanie?”

She shook her head.  “I don’t mind.  I don’t know if it will do any good.  For all we know she’s somehow involved in… whatever this is.”

I nodded slowly, rocking back and forth in the chair.  “She might be.  Who knows, if she is, maybe she’ll come clean and give us some answers.”

“Yeah, maybe.”  She looked down over the mountains in the distance, the valleys between us.  “We should go.  It’ll be dark pretty soon, I don’t want to sleep here.  Or on the ground tonight, for that matter.”

I let the chair fall back to all four legs, standing up.  “I agree.  We should find somewhere to eat, and a hotel.  I need a shower.”

She smiled.  “Yes, you do.”  She looked back into the cabin.  “Do you want to keep any of the other journals or photographs?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know what we’d do with them.  Should hold on to some of the photographs maybe.  I’m gonna take a few pictures of the maps and the rest.  Other than that I don’t think we’ll need it.  Seems like we got the final product anyway.”

“Maybe.”

We had dinner, found a hotel room.  Not as good as the room in New Orleans, marginally better outfitted than the tent.  It didn’t really matter so long as there was a shower and a place to sleep.  I picked up my cellphone, decided to try the hospital, at least find out when Stephanie might work next so I could try to talk to her.  A receptionist answered.

“Hi.  My sister Mallory was a patient there recently, and she said she worked with a nurse named Stephanie.  I was wondering if I could speak with her, or find out when she works next so I could give her a call?”

“What’s this about?”

“Nothing serious.  My sister just said she was very nice.  I wanted to thank her personally, she left a big impression.”

“One second,” and hold music filled my ear.  I walked out of the room, walked out to the parking lot, just to pace.  Someone picked up on the other end.  “Let me transfer you.”

The phone clicked, I waited for a moment, and another voice answered.  “Hello, this is Stephanie.”

“Hi.  I’m sorry, I hadn’t actually expected them to put me through right now.  I hope I’m not interrupting.”

“No problem, sir.  Can I help you?”

“I don’t know, I hope so.  My sister Mallory was a patient there about two months ago.”

“Ok.”

I took a deep breath.  “This is going to sound strange.”

“Yes?”

“My sister, when she was there.  She said you tried to help her when she… well, when she began to start speaking strangely.  Suddenly… I don’t know a better word for it.  Prophesying.”

She was quiet for a moment.  “I remember.”

I paused, collecting my thoughts.  “The thing is, I have a photograph of you.  And I found it in relation to some… things going on in my life right now.  I don’t mean to sound strange, but I’m really kinda grasping at straws here.”

“I don’t think I understand.  A photograph of me?  Have we met?”

“No, I don’t think so.  But you met my sister.  She pointed you out in the photograph.”

“I’m sorry, when was this?”

“Just today.”

She paused, obviously unsure what to say.  “I don’t know what I can do to help you.”

“Look, I know this is probably awkward.  But something has been going on with me recently.  My sister said that you reacted strongly to some of the… prophecy or whatever.  I was wondering if you’d mind telling me why.”

“Sir, I’m not comfortable with the direction this conversation is going.  I’m going to have to let you go.”

“No, please, I’m sorry.  Don’t hang up.”  I had a thought.  I walked to the car and pulled out my bag.  “Hold on for me just one second.”  I pulled out some of the photographs, flipped through until I found a young one of her.  “Listen, I’m not making this up, and I can kind of prove it to you, if you’ll let me.”

“I’m going to hang up.”

“Just one second, please.  I have a photograph of you here as a kid.  You’re nine or ten and you have on a white dress with yellow flowers.  Your left arm is in a cast, and you have your hair in a ponytail.  You’re standing in a field, and there’s an old rusted tractor behind you, a barn in the distance.  You’re wearing braces, or a retainer, I can’t tell exactly.  There’s a toddler standing next to you in green overalls, and you’re holding his hand.”

She was silent.  I thought she’d hung up.  “Hello?”

She cleared her throat.  “I’m here.”

“Are you Ok?”

“Tell me that was just a really good guess.”

“I’m sorry.  I have the photograph in front of me.  But what I’m telling you is that I don’t have any reason to lie about it.  I don’t have anything to gain by making it up.”

“Alright.  Well, so what?  You have a photograph of me as a kid.  At best it’s just weird, at worst you’re some kind of creep.”

“No, listen, I just found it today, among a bunch of other pictures.  Some of you as an adult, too, but a lot more of me, and other people.  You’re just the only one we recognized.”

“We who?”

“My sister and I.”

She didn’t respond for a few moments.  “If you’re somewhere that you can come in to the hospital, it might be easier for us to talk here.”

“I can’t.  I’m in Arkansas.”

“And that’s where you found this photograph?”

“Yes.”

“That doesn’t make sense.  Why would there be a photograph of me in Arkansas?”

“I don’t have any idea.”

“What do you think these are photographs of?”

“I don’t know.  That’s why I’m calling, sort of.  These aren’t the first strange photos I’ve found or received recently.  And I thought since we recognized you, and you’d felt some personal connection with Mallory and her outbursts, maybe you could help me.”

“I still don’t understand.  Help you with what?”

It came down to it, and the only way to say it was to just say it.  “I think someone’s setting me up.  I think someone, or more than one someone, is messing with my life.  Inserting some kind of fabricated history or something.  It’s hard to explain.  I was hoping you could give me some kind of insight.”

“Sir… I’m going to be honest.  I think you should leave Arkansas.  You should come back here, you don’t sound well.  We could talk more about it, and maybe you’d let someone take a look at you.  If you don’t want to leave, then go see someone there.  But you’re not making a lot of sense, and I don’t know that you’re mentally well.”

“I’m sorry.  I don’t know what I was really hoping for, bringing that kind of story to you.”

“No, it’s Ok.  You should just try to talk to someone, preferably soon.  You may need some help.”

“I’ll be alright.”

She didn’t answer for a moment.  When she spoke again, her voice was low, and quiet.  “I need you to listen carefully because I will only say this once.  You’re not wrong.  There is a game being played.  But remember, some of it is real as well as play.  Pay very close attention from now on.  There’s no way out of this for you, but there might be a way through it.”

“Wait, excuse me?  What did you say?”

Her voice was normal again.  “Good night, sir.  Please, try to find someone to talk to.  You need some help.”

She hung up the phone.  I called back but the receptionist couldn’t seem to locate Stephanie anymore.  It made me angry, I slammed the door to the car too hard, and walking back to the room I punched the concrete side of the building, swearing loudly.  It scraped my knuckles but it felt good while I did it.

I sat on the bed, flexing my hand feeling the sting of broken skin.

“You can see why this upsets me, can’t you?”  Her voice wasn’t angry this time.  She seemed past it.

“I just got mad.  It’s not a big deal.”

“With everything else, I think it is.”

“Look, I already told you what happened on the phone.  It would have made you angry, wouldn’t it?”

She looked tired.  “I suppose so.  But God, Chris.  If someone is admitting to you now that they’re intentionally fucking with you, why aren’t we turning around and going home?”

I didn’t make eye contact with her.  I just kept looking down, my voice quiet.  “I still think there’s something out there.”

“Something like what for Christ’s sake?  More fake journals?  More doctored photographs and mysterious keys?  These people are dangerous, Chris.  If they’re willing to, for no reason, spend this kind of time and effort on setting this up, there’s no telling what they might do.  Why they’re doing it in the first place.”

“Don’t you want to know?”

She seemed on the verge of shouting, but not with anger, just a kind of incredulous disbelief.  “No, I don’t.  Neither should you.”

“It’s easier for you to think that.  It’s not happening to you.”

That struck a nerve, and frustration flashed hot.  “What?  Who has been here with you this whole time?  Who fell down in a cemetery speaking nonsense?  I’ve been with you, Chris.  I’ve noticed things too, things have happened to me.  So do you mean the journals weren’t centered on me, you arrogant jerk?  Like this is all about you because somehow you’re in the photographs, because you think she’s writing to you?  It’s been faked!  The whole thing, they’ve practically admitted it.  The only thing that’s been centered on you is some elaborate hoax.”

“That’s not what I meant.”

“That’s how it sounded.”

“I just need to keep going.  I don’t know how else to describe it.  I need to know.”

“I won’t do this anymore, Chris.  I can’t be part of it.”

I didn’t say anything else, neither did she.  I was tired, and put my head down on the pillow behind me, still lying half on and off the bed.  I played our conversation over in my head, somewhere between frustrated and confused, until it dissolved itself into sleep.  I woke up around midnight, and Mallory was gone.
