Epistle Two, that you might be wise.

It is at the careless end that such designs are ever made to fail.  What strategies as we deftly place stretch dangerously too thin, and nearer to the crux we dare, the more chaos holds its sovereign sway.  Look between her fingertips, a greater net may yet draw out, though if to our ends or yours or hers I can no longer from the lay discern.  If you can divine then all may still be gained.

Do you believe it has been my voice to guide?  Perhaps, but not my word.  A time is fast approaching where yours ineloquent and stammering will be the last to ring an echo between the stony walls.  Mine ghosted only, and I, forsaken.  I do not lament it more than is my due, but would beg of you as you should of me, wisdom.  There are so many ways to fail.  If you would bow your head and raise your hands before me, that I might anoint.  But you will not again, and I will not have such time as could make you see.  It was only given once, pray it was enough.

You must hasten your steps, now.  There are only these few left upon the path, but they wait for us just a short while, and will wholly vanish soon.  With all speed and swiftness make your way, and when you know no more, ask.  We will give such answer as we may.

I talked to Mike, explaining the situation the best I could.  He wasn’t thrilled.  But though he didn’t say there would be a job for me when I got back, he didn’t say there wouldn’t be, either.

Stephanie stayed at my apartment the last few nights before I left.  Not trying to convince me against the idea so much as spending what time we had remaining together, implicit in the quiet moments that there was no promise of anything between us once I was gone.  Little parts of me were heartbroken, but more I found myself resolved, an unexpected determination.  A decision to see this through to whatever end, to force some manner of resolution.

And so for a second time I packed up the car.  Stephanie helped me put my sleeping bag and tent in the back, I hoped to camp whenever I had to sleep.  I didn’t have much money left to spend on this.  I put the box of photographs and journals in the car, some water bottles and sandwiches, just like before.  It was a strange doubling of space, packing a car for a similar trip, a different but inarguable uncertainty of purpose.

She gave me a hug.  “Be careful.”

“I will.”

She looked up at me, kissed me quietly.  “You still don’t have to do this.”

I shook my head and kissed her back.  “I feel like I do.”

She didn’t answer.  I looked at the car, back at my apartment door.  I had everything I could think of.  I turned to face her.  “Can I call you when I get back?”

She nodded.  “Yes.”  She hesitated.  “I don’t know what that means, though.”

I put my lips to her forehead, then held her to me.  “That’s Ok.  If you’re willing, we can figure it out.”

She pushed away from me gently and smiled a little.  “If you’re doing this, you should get going, I guess.”

“I should, yeah.”  I walked around to the driver’s side and pulled open the door.  I looked across the top of the car at her.  “I’ll call you.”

She nodded but didn’t answer, and I got in the car and turned the ignition, pulling out of the driveway and away.

I stopped by the cemetery on my way out of town.  I hadn’t been back since I found the letter, too many other things had been more urgent.  I made my way slowly down the winding asphalt drive, stopped near her plot and got out.  I walked to her grave.  Wind was cold now, it had snowed, though it had mostly melted off.  The grass was lifeless, brown and gray.  I stood in front of her tombstone, my hands in my pockets, gusts of wind picking up and dying down, cold but not sustained.

“I’m going to end this, Mal.  The whole thing - the letter, the journals, the photographs, the phone calls.  All of it.”

I looked down at the headstone and sighed.  “I don’t know what you’d make of it.  I can’t tell if I’m doing the right thing by going and trying to put an end to it, or if I’m just playing right in to what they’ve wanted of me the whole time.  I don’t really know what else to do.”

A gust of wind came up, cold sliced through me.  A few leaves blew across below my feet, and it made me smile.  Almost like she was answering.

“If that was a ‘you wouldn’t listen to me anyway’, then you might be right.  I do seem to have a track record of that.”

I looked at the ground.  I bent down and touched it, working my fingers between the dead grass into the cold of the dirt.  I spoke more quietly.

“When I get back… I may start visiting a little less.  I think it might be time I tried to let go a little more.  Talk to someone living about these kinds of things.”  I hesitated, found my eye was tearing from the cold.  Wiped at it and smirked.  “That’s from the wind.”  I paused, took a breath.  “It’s not like I won’t still visit, come to talk.  I think it might just be healthier for me… not to expect so much from a plot of grass, you know?”

I stood up and smiled down at her headstone.  “I’m gonna go.  Wish me luck.”

The road was dark and wet.  I didn’t go south first like before, just started driving west across the country.  The line on the map ended somewhere in New Mexico, but it really could have been to any of a number of towns.  I didn’t have much of a plan beyond getting there, and looking at churches.  I had a photograph of myself from the box of pictures that looked like me at the oldest I had been in any of the photographs.  I assumed it must have been near the end of the path set out by the journals.  In the photograph I was lying prostrate in front of the woman, my hands upraised, one reaching for the hem of her dress.  She was framed by the gate of an adobe-style church, a little sign to the right of the photograph, cut off at the edge.  All I could read of it was “Nuestra Señora.”  I looked it up online, but more than a few churches I could find either were, or had at one point been, named “Our Lady” of one thing or another.  Thought my best bet was to show up and start looking, ask around and hope that the place hadn’t been torn down, or changed so much that no one recognized it.

I drove, stopped at a rest area to eat a sandwich and stretch my legs.  Settled back in and drove until well after it was dark.  I couldn’t find a park where I could camp that was still open, kept on driving until I found another rest area.  I parked off to the side and pulled my sleeping bag from the back of the car, stretched out in the back seat with it around me.  It was cold but I was tired, and I was able to sleep for a few hours.  Woke up just before dawn, someone pulling into the space beside me, a man and a woman shouting at each other as they got out.  Seemed like cue enough for me to get up and get going again.

I drove the whole next day, passed through a lot of rain.  Stopped late in the afternoon somewhere in Oklahoma just outside of Tulsa, bought a real lunch instead of sandwiches.  Sat in the restaurant for longer than I really should have, drinking coffee and thinking.  Looking out the window at the light, cold rain, threatening sleet but not coming down frozen yet.  Tired, wondering if this was really worth it.  I wanted to call Stephanie, just to talk to her, but she would be at work, and I didn’t have anything new to say.  I was just lonely, and a long way from anywhere I wanted to be, ordering a third refill of weak coffee.

Got back on the road, decided to try to make it through Albuquerque.  I was headed farther south, but that was as far as I thought I’d make it before I’d want to stop for the night.  Rain started clearing up as I crossed through the Texas panhandle, and it was clear but dark by the time I crossed the New Mexico border.  Took the interstate on through and finally decided to stop, found a cheap hotel and got a room.  It was cold and I was tired and even if I could find somewhere to camp, I didn’t want to.  And I definitely didn’t want to sleep in the back seat again.  I didn’t unpack the car, just called the desk to set a wake up call for the morning, and fell asleep.  I woke up around eight thirty the next morning, bought a cereal bar from a vending machine for breakfast.  Pulled out of town and drove south.

The more south I drove, the less it seemed like anywhere I’d ever been.  I grew up in a little town, I knew what they were supposed to be like.  But it was different here.  Red rock and dirt granting everything a kind of unexpected expansiveness, things all around like they had more space.  I stopped in the first town I came to that seemed like it might be one worth looking around.  I found a place to leave the car, got out and looked at churches, walking up and down the streets.  Nobody much bothered with me, no one looking at me like they were wondering what I was doing.  Like there was room for me, too, if I wanted to be here, that no one would mind or really notice.  A kind of acceptance that seemed to spring less from welcome and more from the comfort of an open sky, as if there was enough of it that I wasn’t intruding by just being present.

I couldn’t help but wonder why she’d stopped the journey here, among the dust and thirsty plants and poor towns.  What was special, what her reasons were.  In a way I was glad of it, that it was here and not somewhere else, that of the places I could be walking and driving, this was a choice I wouldn’t have expected, but was glad of.  The red earth and boulders by the side of the road made me want to be a different kind of person, a self unlike what I’d been before.  The land was desert, and I felt the geography as a kind of presence, a thing that was aware of me.  Like it was very old, the little wiry bushes compressed by the expanse of sky, twisted and gnarled, surviving low to the ground, as if they’d been there forever, and would be forever, having seen what would come and go, unmoved.  Like somehow there was too much youth in wetter things, my trees and mountain streams back home younger and more transient, and what they gained in exuberance they lost in depth and age like that achieved here in the dry and dust.  I began to think that if the world had begun somewhere, it might be here.

I didn’t find anything the first day except a place to camp, and a place to eat.  I was in my sleeping bag that night, rocks I’d missed clearing away making semi-sharp bumps beneath me, night colder than I’d have imagined when the sun went down.  I missed Stephanie, decided I didn’t care what I’d resolved before, and picked up the phone and tried to call.  It didn’t matter, there was no service.  I twisted to get comfortable on the ground for a while, but eventually got up, put my gloves and hat and jacket on, and went to stand outside.

The moon was showing above me, in the clear air it made the ground almost bright.  No diffusion from humidity, no light lost among some taller trees, just white on the stone and sand, casting shadows from the grasses and gnarled plants.  The stars were sharp points of light, blurring only when my eyes would tear with cold.  I was alone in a new way, now.  A way I couldn’t say I had been before, with a life and a home I could return to, but not those that I must.  That somehow I was out here under open sky, but no longer running.  That it took being so far away and in this alien place to find myself waiting, finally, as if I had returned after some long absence, looking and thinking with eyes and thought no longer wandering or distant, but here.  Present.  And if I was alone, it was not wholly so, a sense of familiar duplication, an awareness of my own immediacy.  I waited for the sound of coyotes, or some other lonesome thing, but there was nothing, just the sound of the wind rushing over the brittle tufts of grass, and flapping at the fabric of the tent.

I woke up the next morning, packed, and drove back into town.  I parked and looked over some of the pages I’d printed before leaving.  There were almost forty Catholic parishes in the Santa Fe diocese alone, and I had no way to be sure the one I was looking for wasn’t further south, on into the diocese based in Las Cruces.  Or, for that matter, that the church was even Catholic, though “Nuestra Señora” made me guess it was, if it still existed.

There was a small church I’d passed yesterday, and I stopped and pulled up to it.  It didn’t look like the right place.  Still, there was a young man out front changing the letters on the sign, replacing an old message with a new.  I thought maybe he could point me to the priest, that I might have a chance to see if he recognized anything in my photograph.  I got out and walked over, he saw me walking, smiled and waved.

“Cold out, isn’t it?”

He nodded, smiling.  “It really is.  Uncomfortable.”

“Yeah, no doubt.”  I paused for a minute, glanced toward the church doors.  “Is the priest around?  I have a few questions I’d like to ask him.”

The young man smiled.  “You’re talking to him.”

“Oh, I’m sorry.  I guess I didn’t…”

“Didn’t expect the priest to be wearing jeans and doing the menial labor?”

I smiled.  “Something like that.”

He smiled and turned, walking back toward the church, gesturing for me to walk with him.  “What can I do for you?”

We walked, and I pulled out the photograph.

“It’s a bit of a strange question.”  I handed him the picture, he took it and looked at it.  “I was wondering if you recognize the church?”

He glanced at it for a little longer, then shook his head, handed it back to me.  “Not really.  Not immediately anyway.  How come?”

I shrugged.  “Just a strange part of my childhood.  I’m looking it back up, but I was just a kid.  I think this was taken in this part of New Mexico, but I’m really just hoping someone will recognize it.”

He shook his head.  “I’m sorry, I don’t know.  I know someone you might ask though.”

“That’d be great, yeah.”

“Her name’s Sarah, she’s a sister over at Saint Michael’s across town.  She’s lived in this area her whole life.  She’s as likely to recognize it as anyone.”

“That’s great.  Thank you.”

“Of course.  I hope it helps.”

He smiled again and we shook hands, he turned and walked up the steps and into the church.  I walked back toward the car, and pulled out to drive.

Saint Michael’s was a bigger church than the other.  It didn’t seem to be the one I was looking for either, though I wasn’t expecting it to be.  I opened the door and walked into the foyer.  To one side there was a sculpture of the church’s namesake, Michael, with his spear thrust through the twisting dragon, just like Saint George before him.  But along the other wall there was another sculpture, a painted statue of the Madonna in blue.  It was beautiful, and I found myself momentarily transfixed by it.  The numinous nature of her, her slender fingers and delicate proportions, lovingly crafted eyes looking with all gentility down, as if toward the world below from a much more sacred space.  A voice startled me.

“I have always found it easiest to worship her like this.  The virgin, Mary or Isis, ephemeral and beautiful, gently brilliant, eternal as starlight.  Young, as if a priestess to her own divinity.  Whatever her many faces, I love this one best.”

I turned around and behind me was standing an old woman, her hair pulled back, her thin shoulders in a bulky sweater.  She had simple shoes and a black skirt and I recognized her as a nun.  She stepped toward me and took my hand, and put another to my cheek, looking me in the eye.  “Many of us have waited for you to come for a very long time, my child.  I am glad to have seen it come to pass.”

I was too surprised to say anything.  She turned and with my hand held in hers began to walk toward the sanctuary.  I let her lead me.  It was hushed, there were a few people in the front pews kneeling and praying.  She looked at them and smiled, touched the holy water and crossed herself as we entered.  I didn’t, not knowing if I should or shouldn’t.  We sat down together, and she still held my hand, looking at me curiously.  I spoke, my voice too loud, though I quickly quieted.  “Is your name Sarah?”

She nodded.  “It is.”

“How do you know me?”

She laughed quietly.  “I knew you when you were just a boy.  I knew you when the Prophet instructed you the first time you were here.”

“Who?”

“The woman from your journals.  We who wait call her the Prophet.  It is as fitting as anything else.”

“I’m sorry, what?” I asked, but my voice was too loud.  People looked back at us, she waved to them, and they turned back away.  She stood and gestured for me to follow her.  I did, not knowing what else to do.  We walked back out of the sanctuary, out of the church and down into a small garden.  Rock paths split it into pretty, natural formations, the sand and red clay earth supported a surprising array of cacti and little shrubs.  She walked in front of me, and began to speak.

“You will have more questions than I have clever answers, son.  And much of what you are likely to ask will be beyond my knowing to tell.”

She walked a little further and led us to a bench.  She sat down and patted the stone slab as if to offer it to me as well.  I sat next to her.

“There.  Now, if you would like to ask loud questions, no one will bother us.”  She smiled.  Her face was kind, wise but without guile, no cruelty in it.  I didn’t know what to think of her.

“Who are you?”

“My name is Sarah.”

“How do you know me, or the woman from the journals?  How could you have just been here, waiting for me?”

She smiled and put her hand on mine.  Her hands were old, wrinkled, but her palm was warm, and she squeezed mine reassuringly.  “I have already told you that I know you, from many years ago.  But I have not been waiting for you, child.  I have been waiting for her.  Your presence here was simply planned a very long time ago, and I am happy to see it coming to pass.”

“I only decided to come here twenty minutes ago.”

She nodded.  “I know.  You didn’t need to know of me or have a reason to find me until twenty minutes ago.”

I sat quietly, then shook my head.  “That doesn’t make sense.”  I reached into my pocket and pulled out the photograph and I handed it to her.  “I was looking for this church.  That’s the only reason I was coming here.  To ask you about it, to see if you recognized it.”

She handed it back to me.  “Then it has played its part, hasn’t it?”

I looked at her and she just smiled.  I took a deep breath.  “Ok.  But I’m really only here for one thing.  I don’t want to be a part of it anymore.  I’m only here to stop all of this.”

She laughed, rocking back a little, and patted my hand.  “Oh, are you?  Child, this pattern was written into you many years ago.  It was never going to matter why you thought you would be here, what you decided your reasons were.  It mattered only that you arrived.  That you’re here, even to stop it, is all that was required.  Stopping this would have been not to come at all, though that was never a choice for you either.”

I didn’t speak for a few moments.  Little of what she said seemed open to response or reproof.  I could accept it or reject it, but without debate.  I asked a question that did not require either.  “Why me?”

“I don’t know.”

I shook my head.  “You must know something.”

“It was not given to me to know, though I would tell you if I could.  Why, at least in the answering, seems often a sole prerogative of the divine.”

I looked around, thinking some feature of the landscape, some tile of the roof or board in the fence, might somehow bring this back to earth.  Pull it back down within a sphere of real where I could gather a sense of stability or context.  Nothing stood out.  I looked back to her.  “Am I going crazy?”

She patted my shoulder.  “No, child.  You are only near now to remembering.  There are folds within folds within folds of time.  We do not always remember because what was past has not yet been, but will be when the time comes rightly to us, and such histories as we uncover will make us something more than sane.  But it has never been a promise gently kept.”

“You have to help me.  I need this all to stop.”

“There is no stopping.  There is only a way through it.”

“What did you say?”

“I said you cannot stop it now.  Nor can I.”

“No.  What you said after.”

“I said there may only be a way through.”

Stephanie had said the same thing, just that way, when I had called her from the road so long ago.  I looked at her, something between anger and fear crawling up my spine.  “Who told you to say that?”

“It is simply a fact.”

“Someone told you what to say, didn’t they?  Are you really part of this?  Have you ever been, or were you just set up, like the others, given lines to say, things to try to make me believe?”

She nodded as if in understanding.  “Yes, some were told to say one thing, and some were told to say another.  If you have been given the same wisdom twice, it is a blessing only.  I was given no script from which to read.  I, with her, was first to devise all the rest.”

I paused.  “Are you telling me you were the one to set up phone calls with threats and promises?  To use people against me who didn’t even know me?”

“Among other things.”

“Did you write the journals?”

She shook her head.  “No.  Though I compiled drafts of such prophecy as she would complete it.  I ordered them and reordered as I understood.”

“Then who put them at my door?”

“I don’t know.  Others than I managed that small piece.”

I looked down at the stones, at the dirt.  I scuffed my foot in a footprint I had left, trying to think of questions that might actually help.  Ones she might stop dodging with deft answers that said nothing.  “What do the photographs mean?”

“I don’t know that either.  They are symbols of an initiation to which I am not privy.”

I sat in silence.  I didn’t know what else to ask, what more I could try to accept before I would find myself incapable of acting or thinking.  “This isn’t real.”

She laughed again, her shoulders shaking in her bulky sweater.  “And how would you be the one to judge?”  Finally she put her hand on my knee, and patting it, stood up.  “Walk with me, a little while longer.”

I stood.  Again, I didn’t know what else to do, so I followed.  “Where are we going?”

“Just a short way from here.  There is something more you need to see.”

We left the church grounds, and began to walk through a small neighborhood.  Kids were playing in the street, kicking a ball back and forth.  One of them missed and it came toward me, I stopped it and kicked it back to them.  Sarah walked quietly, then turned down a smaller street.

“Here we are.  Not much farther now.”

“Farther till what?”

“I am taking you to her home.”

I felt cold.  “Who?”

She looked at my face and smiled.  “Don’t worry.  She won’t be there.  You are not to meet her yet.”

I shook my head.  “Whose home are we going to?”

“The Prophet’s.”

There was wind blowing and my stomach was tight and my legs seemed to slow.  After so many months of wondering, it seemed unreal.  I was afraid of her, this prophet, suddenly, and more than I had recognized.  As if without conscious memory, some part of me still knew to be afraid.  “Why?  Why go if she’s not there?”

“It would do us little good to wait for her.  She has been gone for many years.”

“Gone how?”

She smiled and shook her head.  “We don’t know.  She has simply never returned.  Whether dead, hiding, or as Elijah taken to heaven, she has gone.  But she said it may be so, before the goddess was to come.”

“Why take me there if she’s gone for good?”

“There are things that have been left for you.  Things that you must see.”

She turned toward a modest looking house, walking up the driveway.  I stopped in the street and looked at it, unable to believe what I was seeing.  It could have been any house.  Dormant winter plants, a skeletal tree clacking lightly in the wind.  Brick facade, a single car garage.  Small shrubs beneath the windows with dead brown leaves, patchy where they had not all yet fallen.  I stood still and felt as if I couldn’t walk forward, the conjunction of such mundanity and the surreality of this prophet and her acolytes.  I stared at the house and found myself doubting its walls and bricks and concrete walk.  A mother and children could at any moment bustle out on their way to ballet or soccer practice.  There could have been a minivan in the garage, christmas decorations shoved in a corner behind forgotten exercise equipment.

Sarah looked back at me and gestured for me to walk with her.  As if reading thought from my expression, she smiled.  “Everything touched by the Mystery hides in perfectly plain sight.”  I walked up the driveway behind her, she unlocked the door and we went in.

The interior wasn’t notable except that it was ascetic.  A few pieces of plain furniture, barren walls.  Bookshelves were the only decoration, and those filled to bursting.  There was no television set, no dining room table, nothing that indicated any thought of comfort, nothing for entertaining the resident or even an incidental guest.  It seemed to have been immaculately cleaned and preserved, though the emptiness of the place was almost tangible.  Sound in the rooms surprised at being suddenly heard, echos with pause of hesitation as if taking some small effort to recall the mechanism of their duty, coming back overloud in compensation.

She led me down the hall and into one of three bedrooms.  It was outfitted as an office, a sturdy wooden desk in a corner, more bookshelves along the walls.  A lamp that she switched on, giving it a warmer glow.  I looked around the room.  One wall was covered in photographs.  As I looked, I realized it wasn’t random, but rather hundreds of of them as if in succession.  I walked closer, and turned on a second lamp near the wall.  I would have recoiled had I not already begun to slip into some distant other space, my mind no longer as it common was, my thoughts seeming strange and unsound.

“This is impossible.”

“It has already happened.”

I looked at the wall.  “I don’t remember it.  There are too many.”

“It will happen.  Or has.  Think of it as you like.  But it is the truth.”

I stared at the wall.  There were hundreds of photographs, each like the ones I had been sent.  But they were arranged as if marking the progress a kind of drama, still frames of a film catching actions in transition.  I recognized prints of the same photographs I had been sent, and where they coincided with mine they were framed in red or black or white.  It was as if the ones I had been sent were the stasis moments in some larger staging, iconic frozen pieces in a much longer chain of movements.  My age grew through these much more fluidly, and the locales behind us changing more naturally, gentle hills staying gentle hills for longer, becoming mountains and down rolling once again to open plains, slipping further to darkened swamps, but only slowly, dozens of photographs in transition between state to state.

And though I was rattled and unnerved by this, it was the final piece that threw me, that made me worry for my safety and my sanity.  As my age changed in the photographs, so too did the woman’s, but there was a strange gap.  On the wall the transitions suddenly stopped.  In the last photograph before the gap she was standing alone, naked and holding a knife.  She was in her mid forties, black hair unbound and down about her body, her skin white, her eyes sharp.  And then there was the gap, a space for some dozen or so pictures not yet taken.  And beyond it the chain began again, but she was now old.  I recognized her but she had aged, her hair white-gray and stringy, her body withered and sagging.  But her posture had not changed, she was naked yet with the knife, but her hand was now bloody.  And the photos receded from some dark space beyond the flash of the camera, until I as a young boy emerged, as young as I had been at the beginning.  I was pale like her in the flash, and I walked to her and I took her hand, though in the photographs I stared straight into the camera, as she did.

And together in the photographs we turned and we walked into the black.

I didn’t speak for some long minutes, staring at the wall of photographs, trying to make sense of it.  Finally I came to myself and I turned toward Sarah.  She was standing, looking at me but not the wall.

“This can’t be real.  She has grown old at the end, and I have grown young.”

“It is real.  Or will be made so.”

“What do you mean, it will be?  There are photographs of it already.”

“Yes.”

I looked back at the wall, then toward her, gesturing to the whole of it, my voice beginning to rise.  “This doesn’t make sense.  Please, just tell me what it is!”

She shook her head.  “A ritual, the symbols of which were not to me disclosed.  The meaning was not for me.  The goddess is mine in other ways, but she is yours in this.”

“What is this supposed to make me think?  Why did you show me this?”

“I showed you because she said you were to see it.”

“Why?  Why show it to me if you can’t tell me what it means?”

“Because knowledge is not the only path to truth.  You do not need to know, only to see, and act.  Wisdom is bought not so cheaply as a minute’s exposition, the words abandoned as soon as they are heard.”

“I’ve had enough of this.”  I turned and pushed past her and walked out of the room.  I walked out of the house and back into the road.  I was angry and I wanted to walk back to my car, but my legs were weak underneath me, and I was shaking more than I had realized.  My breath came short and I sat down heavily on the curb, my heart pounding in my ears, the impossibility of this weighing dangerously on me.  I was somewhere beyond a fear of going mad.  I put my head in my hands, and I tried to hold myself still from trembling.

Sarah followed me out some minutes later, as if she knew I wouldn’t go far.  I heard her pull the door closed, and walk down the driveway toward me.

“I’m sorry.”

I looked at her, my eyes unseeing.  I didn’t answer.  She put her hand on my shoulder.  It was unwelcome but I didn’t move to shrug it off.

“I’m sorry there is no easier way.”

I looked down into the gray of the worn asphalt of the street.  I picked up a few small rocks from where it met the concrete of the curb.  “I don’t want any of this.  I just want it to be over.  I want to go home, to live my life.  I want this to end.”

She patted my shoulder and stood up, but didn’t answer.

We walked together back to her church.  I didn’t speak, and she didn’t say anything important, commenting on the neighborhood, how it was still a nice one after so many years.  That families lived here, and that she enjoyed the children who would come to the Sunday services.  Said that I had enjoyed them when I was here once before, though of course I didn’t remember.  The wind began to blow harder and she seemed small and old and frail in the cold, but she walked faster and more vigorously than I did myself, though I was withdrawn intensely into my own thoughts, less concerned with stride.

She lead me to the back of the church and brought me into the kitchen.  She sat me down and made coffee, which I took without really looking up.  I murmured a thank you on autopilot.  After what must have been at least half an hour I looked around, as if returning to consciousness.  She was drinking her coffee and looking at me, but without impatience or worry.  I set my cup down and looked at her.

“What am I supposed to do?”

“I don’t know.  That is why there is a gap.”

“In the photographs?”

“Yes.  What you are to do is beyond even her ability to clearly mark.  It is your own.”

“Then why am I here?  Why manipulate me here if you don’t even know what I’m supposed to do?”

“Because we know the outcome of it.”

I shook my head, beginning to retreat again, my thoughts reeling.  I felt as if I was losing even an outline of myself, no shape or silhouette against the background, only transparent and fading.  She took my hand.  “It will be alright, child.”

“I don’t think it will be.”

She smiled.  “I cannot tell you what it is you are to do.  But I can tell you where it is you must go.”
