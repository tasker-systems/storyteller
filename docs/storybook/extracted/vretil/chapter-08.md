Epistle Eighteen, the sacred cup.

Though they have forgotten, I have not, and if we must abandon much, it is upon the surface only, a ghosted visage in reflection.  Toward the water and in the dark, coils writhing beneath our step, and if afraid, only as the child must clamor to be born, and us anew.  Here in the black and among the scaled things, there is the grail of our unmaking.  Catch it in your grasp and hold it high aloft, and in salutation drain the draught.  In bitterness and choking, rejoice your treasure so hard won.

There is history of man and history of men, and like jailors guard us all, and with stars bind us to our cells.  With shaking hand I accuse the culpability of heaven.  Release us!  The keys are in your waistcoat pocket, ticking all the while.  She comes soon to throw open gates, though her face be terrible, and gorgon strike us down.  For we have become old, our thoughts decayed, obsessed of the brilliant articulations of our own annihilation.  By serpent slain we must descend, and speak a holy name to a child only part our own.

But she will stand with a secret smile, hand to our dying face, and in the splintered moments of our death, whisper what wisdom we could not mortal bear.

-----

We drove through Florida’s panhandle, on into Alabama.  For the most part we drove in quiet, listening to the rain.  It wasn’t coming down hard, just enough to keep the lights on and make us drive a little more slowly.  Hundreds of flat, straight miles of road slicing their way through the trees, framed overhead by gray and beneath us by asphalt, it too gray with use and age.  We passed through Mobile, only stopping for gas and food.  We found a restaurant and sat at a little table in the corner, out of the way of the lunch crowd.

Mallory had picked out our next destination, a little state park south of New Orleans.  She was showing me the photograph, and in it I was standing in a puddle, facing the camera, a styrofoam cup held in one hand, raised up like I was giving a toast.  There was a rope wrapped around one of my legs, then up my arm.

Mallory pointed.  “You see the sign behind you?”

I leaned in closer.  “Barely.  I can only read a few letters.”

“Me too.  But I compared them with state and national parks around the country.  Based on the path we’ve marked out, I was able to narrow it down, I think.”

“Alright.”  I ate a few more bites, looked at her.  “So, do we have any idea on this one?  I don’t know if I want a repeat of last time.”

She looked at me flatly.  “A repeat of what?”

“The prophesying.”

“That wasn’t my fault.”

“I’m not saying it was.  I’m just wondering if there’s anything in the journals that might give us an idea of what was going on the last time I was here.  Anything we should try to be aware of before we get there, anything that might add unnecessary stress.”

She shrugged, ate another potato wedge off my plate.  “I don’t think so.”

“You sure?”

“No.  There was really only enough for me to guess we should be heading to Louisiana.  You read these too, you know.”

“Yeah, but you’re the smart one.”

“That’s a lazy answer,” but she laughed a little.  I laughed back.

The waitress came with the check, I gave her a credit card, and Mallory stood up.  “I’m gonna go to the restroom.  I’ll meet you outside.”

I finished paying, left the restaurant, and went to stand on the covered porch.  Wood flooring planks extended down the whole front, some rocking chairs with no one in them off to the side.  I walked over and sat down, looking out at the sky.  Gray still, raining, sound of traffic on the road behind the building.  I couldn’t see it but I could hear it.  I thought about the photograph, wondered what a cup and rope meant, why in some little park.  It was strange though, because for the first time I began to feel like some of this was familiar.  Probably just the monotony of driving, billboards and trees and jockeying around the same few cars for hours.  But for whatever reason, I felt like I was remembering something.

Mallory came out, walked to the rocking chairs.  “You look like an old man sitting there.”

I shrugged.  “Maybe I’m getting old.”

She laughed, hit my leg with her purse.  “C’mon.  You ready?”

“Yeah.”

We drove a long way, almost all the way through New Orleans.  We decided to stop once we were near the far side of the city limits, finding a hotel once we got off the highway.  I paid for a room and got back in the car.  It was almost dark, Mallory was excited to get out and go see the city.  She wanted to eat something with crawfish in it, drink too much, and listen to blues.  I just wanted to sleep.  I put the car in gear and drove around to the side lot, parked and got out.  Grabbed just my bag of clothes, walked in the side entrance and down the hall, and unlocked the door to the room.

It was nicer than the others, though it had cost more too.  I looked around at it and thought we couldn’t really afford it.  We’d end up broke by the end of the trip if we stayed in places like this too often, though for tonight it felt good.  Air conditioning seemed to work like it should, and the walls weren’t paper thin.  Comforters on the beds were fuller, looked more expensive.  The lamps were more tasteful, there were landscape painting prints of ducks and wetlands on the walls.  There was a fridge and a microwave and a coffee pot, and the desk had said there was 24 hour room service.

Mallory walked in behind me and let the door close.  “This is more like it.”

“Seriously.”  I walked in, tossed my bag on the bed.  There was a couch and a real chair, not just a couple of plastic ones around a flimsy table.  I sat down, slipped off my shoes and put my feet up on the coffee table.  Mallory bounced down on the couch.

She didn’t stop bouncing.  “I want to go out.  Let’s do something.”

I let my head loll back on the chair, sighing.  “I’m tired, Mal.”

She stood up from the couch, grabbed my hand, trying to pull me up.  “Come on.  How often are we in New Orleans?”

“Can we just wait until tomorrow?  It’ll still be there.”

“Do you really want to sleep?  It’s New Orleans, Chris!”

I leaned forward, ran my hands through my hair.  “Look, it’s just that I drove all day.  And these last few days haven’t exactly been restful.  I’m tired.”

“One drink.”

“Mal…”

“There’s a little place just up the road.  I saw it on the way in.  We can even walk there if you want, it’s not far.  Let’s just go have one drink, just to say we did something fun while we were here.  Then I’ll get you back here and you can sleep.  Since you really are becoming an old man.”

“Just one, and then I can sleep?”

“Yes.”

I stood up slowly.  “Alright.”  I smiled at her.  “Really, how often are we in New Orleans, anyway?”

One turned into two turned into six turned into more than I counted.  I woke up even more glad of decent beds and the coffee pot.  Mallory woke up to the sound and smell of it brewing, groaning quietly.

“Oh god.  What time is it?”

“We’ve got about an hour before checkout.”

She just whimpered again and rolled back over.

“You’ve got no one to blame but yourself for this.”

“Me?  I’m the psych patient.  You’re the responsible one.”  She stood up, stumbled toward the bathroom.  “I get the shower first.”

“You want breakfast?”

She leveled a stare at me.  “Just make the coffee.”  I laughed at her.  She turned the faucet on, called through the door.  “So, who was that girl you ended up talking to last night?”

I had to struggle to remember.  Names and faces were blurry or absent.  She’d seemed nice, I thought.  “I don’t remember.  Trish, maybe?  Tina?  I think I have a number here somewhere.”

“You can’t remember her name?  That’s nice, very classy.”

I walked over to my clothes, dug through the pockets, but didn’t find anything.  Clothes smelled like cigarette smoke, sweat, and the sour of spilled beer.  “Hey, you have anything you need washed?  I’m gonna go see if they have a laundry room.  My clothes stink.”

“Yeah, the stuff in the white pillowcase in my bag.”

I grabbed my wallet and room key, and with an armload of clothes walked out the door.  A maid was pushing a cart down the hall, I jogged a little to catch up with her before she went into the elevator.  “Excuse me, miss?”

She looked at me like something was wrong.  “Sorry, I have to go.”  The elevator slid open and she backed into it, pulling the cart.  She was looking at me like something was frightening her.  I put my hand on the elevator door.

“I’m sorry, I just wondered if the hotel had a laundry room.  I’m afraid some of these don’t smell so good.”  I smiled, trying to be polite, disarming.

She backed further into the elevator, her cart in front of her like she could hide behind it.  “Down the hall, to your left.  Please, I need to go.”

I pulled my hand away from the door.  “Alright, Ok.  Sorry for the trouble.”

The elevator doors shut, I could hear it begin to lift.  I walked down the hall, looking to my left as I passed, found the laundry room.  There was no one inside, I walked in, opened one of the washing machines, and tossed in the clothes.  Used the change machine to get enough quarters to buy some detergent and run the load.  I pushed the coins in and started it, and leaned back for a moment against the wall of dryers on the other side.

My head hurt and I was still tired.  It was stupid to have gone out to drink, I could really have used the rest.  I let my eyes drift, half closing over informational posters, a shelf of pamphlets for restaurants and scenic places, booklets of coupons.  They were dusty, some beginning to fade, like they hadn’t been looked at or replaced in a long time.  Among them was a stack of brown paper flyers with the name of the state park we were planning to go see.  I leaned down and picked one up, flipping it open.  I began to read the description, had a vague sense that I’d heard it before.

My eyes began to close.  Thrumming of the washer, the room was warm, neon lights buzzing enough to make my eyes tired trying to read.  They began to slide shut without my intending for them to.  I half-heard a song being sung down the hall, what little thought I gave it assumed it must be a guest or hotel staff.  It was a curious, delicate melody, and strange, I thought, that I could hear it over the washer.  Little scenes began to play in front of my eyes, almost dreaming.  My shoulders relaxed, my hand barely held the flyer.  My head began to sink down, my chin to my chest.  The song was pretty, had a haunting, lilting quality, as if I almost recognized it.  It seemed to come nearer to the door.  My eyes closed entirely, and my thoughts, such as I could direct, focused on the song, the voice of a woman singing over the vibration of the washer.  It drew nearer, I was all but asleep, dreaming, awake only that I knew I was soon not to be.

The room was dark, and still.  I couldn’t remember when the washer had shut off.  My mind tried to rouse itself, but sleep held on.  The song was by my side now, the sound of it at my shoulder, now in my ear.  I could feel the breath of the singer, a mouth near my face, the song like heartache somehow, breaking me.  I felt as if I should weep, fall down to my knees and hope only that it might continue, that such strange melancholy might not abandon.  The song grew more terrible.  I saw dark places, vines hanging and the burning eyes of things in the black.  The voice came out from among them, calling me, a trembling fear in my chest beginning to wake, steps I did not want to take, urging me in syllables I could not decipher.  I heard my name, quietly, in the stillness.  I heard it again more loudly.  I heard it finally shouted in my ear, and I woke with a start, the washing machine still running, the lights on in the room.  I looked about me, a kind of panic creeping over my skin, but there was no one here with me.  No one singing.  I darted to the door and looked down the hall both ways, but no one was there.  My heart was pounding, the hair on the back of my neck standing up.

Except to flip the clothes to the dryer, I stood in the hall against the opposite wall and waited until they were done.

“You gonna try that again?”

We were in the park.  It wasn’t anything of note, the kind of historical site no one ever remembers the details of, but pretty in a bayou kind of way.  Broad shade trees, ground soft, muddy beneath the fallen leaves.  Sun hadn’t managed to break through the clouds, bits of fog still lingering along the ground, rising off the water in the distance.  I was standing near the sign, looking at the photograph of me in the picture.

“I don’t have any rope.  You think it matters?”

She looked at me and laughed.  “Of course I don’t think it matters.  All you’re going to do is get your boots filthy if you stand over there.  It looks really muddy.”

“Last time I did this, you started prophesying.”

“That was upsetting and not my fault.  Anyway, this is not nearly as creepy as a stone angel in a graveyard.”

I looked around, and thought she was right.  There were a few pickup trucks parked near the ranger’s station, our little car next to them looking out of place.  The fog seemed more damp than haunted.  We’d paid our two dollar entrance fee, Mallory had the camera out, but wasn’t taking any pictures.  I was trying to figure out relatively where I’d have been standing for the photo to have been taken, what in the world a styrofoam cup and rope meant.  I turned around and stood near the sign, held my coffee cup up like in the picture.  Mallory started laughing at me.

“You look ridiculous.”

I smiled, keeping my arm out for a moment before letting it down.  “I’d imagine.”  I walked over to where she was standing, looking out at the water in the distance, the spanish moss in the trees.  “What’re you thinking?”

She gestured to the far right bank of the little lake.  “I’d like to walk over there.  It looks pretty, might be something worth taking pictures of.”

“Sure.”

We walked toward the water, the gnarled fingers of the cypress stumps twisting down, knuckles cresting again above, the little wiggle of minnows, water bugs and whirligigs on the surface.  From time to time we’d hear something splash, see ripples ringing out from the bank, or the unmistakable serpentine shape of a snake swimming across the water.  A blue heron standing with its long legs half-submerged, dipping its bill down in ceaseless investigation, picking a deliberate path through the shallows.  Nothing ever wholly still, even in the quiet of the moss and mist.

We came to a little placard on a metal stand, declaring the land had been donated by someone I’d never heard of.  We were near the bank, trees growing clustered at the lake’s edge, so much moss we had to walk past some of the lower boughs to see the water.  Mallory raised the camera, took a picture of the heron across on the other bank.  “So, what’re we looking for?”

I stepped down to the water, picked up a stick and began to break it into little pieces, tossing the bits in, bothering the minnows.  “I don’t know.”

“Remembering anything?”

“It’s hard to tell.  It seems familiar.  Everything since Mobile has seemed a little familiar.”

“Maybe we’re on the right track then.”

I tossed the rest of the stick on the ground.  “Maybe.”

She looked at the water where I was kneeling.  She smiled.  “Go stand on the stumps.”

I looked at her.  “What?  Why?”

“It’ll make a good picture.  Something to prove we’re having an adventure.”

I laughed.  “You’re crazy.”

“Oh, just go do it.  Don’t be such a killjoy about everything.”

I kept laughing, but walked to the edge, put my hand on the trunk of the nearest tree.  I put one foot on a stump, then reached out to another.  My boots were muddy, but I was able to stand.  “Ok.  Take your picture before I fall the hell down.”

“Not like that.  Let go of the tree, pose or something.  You look like a kid regretting a dare.”

I put my hands on my hips, pushing my chest out.  “Like this?”

“Sure, superman.  Hold still.”  She looked down at the camera, then pulled it up to her eye.  Then she slowly lowered it.  “Oh, shit.  Chris, hold very still.”

“Mal, hurry up.  I’m going to fall off this if I don’t get down soon.”

“Chris, seriously, do not move.  Don’t look down, don’t shift your feet.  There’s a very big snake swimming between the stumps you’re standing on.  It’s twisting around.”

“That’s not funny.”

“I’m not kidding.  Don’t move.”

Slowly, without moving my legs, I tilted my head down just enough to look into the water.  She wasn’t lying, there was a snake just below me.  My legs began to quiver, I couldn’t do anything to stop it.

“Chris, don’t move.  I’m going to go get a stick or something.  Try to scare it away.”

“Whatever, just… shit.  Don’t make it angry.”

Mallory turned around and began to look for something long enough to poke at it with.  The snake turned back toward me, twisting its body around the stump beneath the water, lifting its head up.  I began to panic.  My legs were shaking visibly, my feet felt like they were slipping.  It put its head on my shoe, and began to coil around my ankle.  Mallory picked up a stick and turned around, but realized it was too late to do anything.  “Chris…”

“I know… I - “  My foot slipped.  I lost my balance, and I turned, falling toward the water.  I angled my body the best I could at the last moment to avoid landing on any sharp stumps, the snake still twined about my ankle.  I fell in.  Water went over my head, and for a moment everything went very black.

I remembered.  I was child, no more than seven.  The sky was dark, and I was standing in this lake, trembling with cold and fear.  The moon was overhead, its face brilliant, shimmering on water about me.  There was a woman standing on the bank, and she held her arms in the shape of an L, and she called up to the sky.  “By this, the sign of Isis, I do baptize now this child.  In the dark of dread Apophis, may yet the goddess turn her eye.  Bleed, moon, and bless your son, who born of absent womb does to you orphan come.”  She took a long straight knife and cut a pattern into the air before her, the glint of it beneath the moonlight tracing a glittering hieroglyph.

My sight returned, my eyes opened in time to see the snake swim by my face and away.  I lurched up from the water and scrambled to the shore, gasping and shaking.

Mallory ran to me, dropping to the ground.  “Oh my god Chris, are you Ok?”  She pulled the leg of my pants up, looking at my ankle and calf.  “Did it bite you?  Shit, we need to get you to the hospital.”

I gasped.  “No, Mal, I’m alright.  It didn’t bite me.”

She looked over my legs, my arms.  “Are you sure?”

I rolled over on my back.  “Yeah.”  I coughed and spit water on the ground.

“Are you sure you’re Ok?  You were under the water for like thirty seconds.  I was freaking out, I wanted to grab your leg but I couldn’t see the snake.”

I turned my head.  “Thirty seconds?  Really?”

“At least.”

I stood up, brushed myself off some.  “I need a towel.  Help me walk to the car, I think I bruised some ribs on a stump.”

I put an arm around her, and she helped me start walking.  We got to the car, opened the trunk and got a towel.  The ranger walked out of the office.

“Hey, you alright?”

I nodded.  “Yeah, thanks.  Was just looking at the water, got too close and slipped in.”

“Be careful around there.  Snakes get up in them stumps.  Hospital’s got some anti-venom, but it ain’t pleasant.”

I couldn’t help laughing a little.  “Thanks.  I’ll keep it in mind.”

I sat against the car, toweled off my head, then leaned back, resting for a minute.  Mallory stood looking pensively at me.  I lifted my head and looked at her, then past her.  I stared at the trees, back at the spot where I’d fallen.

Mallory asked, “Are you Ok?”

“Yeah.”  I looked back at her, my voice lowering, speaking quietly.  “I remembered something.”

“Remembered what?”

“Something from when I was here before.  When I was under the water, it was like I saw something else.”

She walked over and began to look at my scalp.  “Shit, did you hit your head?  Let me look, you might have a concussion.”  I laughed and swatted her away from my head.  She wasn’t laughing.  “Chris, it could be serious.  Let me look.”

“It’s fine.  My head doesn’t hurt.  At least not any more than it did this morning.”

“God you’re stubborn.”  She crossed her arms.  “Fine.  So what did you see?”

“I was a kid.  It was night time, and I was standing in the lake, up to my knees.  I was shivering, it was really cold in the water, and I was scared.  The woman from the photographs was standing on the bank, holding her arms out.  She said that she was baptizing me here, then waved a knife in the air.”

“What?”

I shook my head.  “I don’t know.  That was it.  Next thing I know that snake was swimming past me and I was shrieking like a little girl to get out of the water.”

“You did, but with good reason.  That thing was huge.”

We decided to go back into the city, walk around the French Quarter some, see the sights.  We stopped and listened to jazz and blues, performers that were probably better than I had the ear to appreciate.  Ate jumbalaya and red beans and rice, but my mind wasn’t really on it.  The woman on the bank, speaking into the night sky, was all I could see.  It didn’t mean anything to me, and I didn’t understand it.  Not any better than the rest of this.  But it was the first thing I’d remembered, really remembered that fit with the photographs.  Until then I’d been worried that I couldn’t remember anything.  Now I was worried because I had.  My eyes passed over the wrought-iron balcony railings and the stone fleur de lis without really appreciating much of anything.  Eventually we sat down on a bench, just watching people go by.

“You alright?” Mallory nudged me.  “You’ve been pretty quiet since we left the park.”

Took me a moment to rouse, blinked my eyes from the far off place they’d focused.  “Yeah, I’m Ok.”

“Seems like you’ve been pretty lost in your thoughts.  I don’t know if you’ve actually seen half of what we’ve looked at this afternoon.”

I smiled.  “I’m sorry.  Guess I’m a little distracted.”

“It’s alright.  Makes sense.”

I didn’t answer, my eyes drifting deep again.  I turned to look back at her.  “It’s just… the implication of remembering.  I mean, was it real?  Or did the memory just create itself in response to the stress?”

She shrugged.  “I don’t know.”

“What do you think?”

She didn’t answer immediately.  She watched a couple of tourists walk by, not much different than us, camera out, pointing and chatting.  When she did, she didn’t look at me.  “I think I’m worried about you.”

“So, you think it’s in my head.”

“No, that’s not what I meant.  It’s possible you invented the memory subconsciously.  It’s way more common than people think.  But I wasn’t trying to say that.  I’m just worried about what the trip is doing to you, how it’s making you feel and think.  I don’t know if it’s good for you.”

“You sound like me now, worried about you.”

“Maybe it’s my turn.”  She was quiet for a moment, then looked at me.  “I think something is going on here.  I’m not denying that.  But what it is may not be good for you.  If you forgot it all once, there’s probably a good reason.”

I didn’t have an answer.  We sat, each as if waiting for the other to continue, until finally the silence became untroubled again, no longer expectant.  While we sat quietly, a kid came up behind us, wearing a red ball cap.

He flashed a smile, I smiled back.  “Hi.”

He smiled more broadly, put out his hand.  “Hi.  My name’s Jean-Pierre.  What’s yours?”

I took his hand and shook it.  “Chris.  Nice to meet you, Jean-Pierre.”

“You a tourist?”

“Yeah.  Just visiting.  You live around here?”

“Yep.  Live with my uncle.  You should go talk to him, he knows a lot.”

“He does, huh?  What does he know a lot about?”

“Everything.  But I heard all your talking.  He helps people like you sometimes.”

“I’m sorry Jean-Pierre.  Helps with what?”

“Everything!”  He walked over to a light pole and unchained his bike, hopped on it.  “He lives at the end of the street, two blocks that way.”  He pointed to the right.  “Car shop with a red sign, like my hat!  Henri’s.”  He waved at us and peddled off.

I turned to look at Mallory.  “Any idea what that was about?”

She was smiling, began to laugh quietly.  “None.  Cute kid though.”

“Yeah, he was.”

Neither of us spoke for a moment, then she looked over at me.  “You want to go talk to his uncle, don’t you?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know, maybe.  I mean why not?  Worst thing that can happen is that he’ll think I’m some lunatic tourist.”

“What in the world are you going to say?”

“I don’t know, I was just gonna figure it out as I went.  Enough weird stuff has been happening to me that….  Hell, maybe a kid telling me to talk to his uncle is worth paying attention to.”

“You’re beginning to believe all this, aren’t you?”

“No…  Hell, I don’t know.”  I paused, looked down the street after the kid, then back at Mallory.  “I feel like something’s going on in my head.  I’m beginning to think maybe the journals might not be totally insane.  It’s not like I’m not saying I believe everything in them… just that maybe there’s something to parts of it.”

“This?  This is why I’m worried about you.”  But she laughed, and stood up and grabbed my arm, pulling me forward.  “Go on then.  You’ll just mope if you don’t.”

I smiled.  “I don’t mope.”

“Right.  I’m going to walk around a little more, take a few more pictures, maybe get something to drink.  You go see your mechanic.  I’ll meet you back here in about an hour.”

I found my way to Henri’s just like the kid said.  I walked up to one of the open garage doors, middle aged man inside working on a truck.  As I walked in he looked up, nodded at me.  “Afternoon.  Can I help you?”

I hadn’t really realized how awkward it would sound to explain.  I cleared my throat.  “Hi.  I’m actually not sure.  I met a kid a few blocks over named Jean-Pierre.  He said I should talk to his uncle.”

He stood up, wiped his hand off on a oil rag.  “Name’s Henri.  Jean-Pierre’s my nephew.”  He extended his left hand, I stepped forward and shook it.  His right hand was holding on to the oil rag, and was missing the last two fingers at the knuckle.  He had on a red hat with Henri’s printed across it, same design as the name on the sign above the shop.

“Chris.”

He looked back at the engine.  “What can I do for you?”

I looked down, unsure what to say.  “Jean-Pierre said sometimes you help people.”

He looked back over at me and seemed to take stock of me, head to foot.  He leaned on the truck with his elbow.  “Sometimes.  We’re not talkin’ about a car, yeah?”

“No, not exactly.”

He turned back, picked up a wrench.  “Don’t have time to go inside today, I need to finish this.  You wanna talk, that’s fine, but you do it while I work.”

“Yeah, no, that’s great.  Thanks.”  He didn’t say anything else, was just quiet.  I felt uncomfortable.  “I’m not sure where to start.”

He glanced up for a second.  “Don’t matter to me.  Tell you what though, how about you skip everything you think’s so important.  How you got here, what you’re doing.”

“I’m sorry?”

“Everybody wants to tell a story.  Tell you all about what happened, what they done or didn’t, why or why not.  Don’t mean to offend, but I don’t really care about it.  Never really turns out to be all that important, anyway.”  He paused, tightened something inside the truck, then turned to look at me.  “The story doesn’t matter, not like the past’s gonna tell you what you oughtta do now.  Everyone spends so much time fixing up history to make it all fit together pretty.  Thinkin’ they gotta make the same thing out of what comes next.”

“What should I say then?”

“Tell me what you looking for.  Only real place to start.”

The question left me quiet.  I couldn’t think of what to say in response.  Some half-formed idea about finishing a journey, spending time with my sister.  I could have said I was just looking for some time to think, to get my life back into shape, and that would have been true enough, too.  But it was about the journals.  At least it was now.  There was something I felt inside of them.  Something the woman wrote about, something intangible that made me want to seek after something else.  Something more.

I surprised myself as the words came out.  “I’m looking for a goddess.”

He looked up at me, but he didn’t smile.  He didn’t laugh, just shook his head.  “Dangerous to look for spirits.  Sometimes they look back.”

I nodded.  “I know.”

“Do you?”

“I think that’s why I’m here.  I think something’s looking back.”

“You got a problem, then.”

“Why’s that?”

“‘Cause if that’s so, then you looking for spirits, and you chased by spirits.”

“What?”

He didn’t answer, just finished tightening.  He set the wrench down, pointed at the driver’s seat.  “Go turn the key.”  I got in, put it in neutral, one foot on the brake and the other on the clutch, turned the key.  It turned over, I gave it a little gas.  He waved at me from around the open hood.  “More.”  I revved it again, engine roared but then sputtered and died.  He waved his hand for me to stop.  “Damn.  Enough.”

I got back out, he stood staring at the engine.  I walked to the side and stared at it as well, though it wasn’t like I knew enough to help.  He leaned back in under the hood.

I cleared my throat.  “What did you mean chased by spirits?”

His voice was muffled, a little strained as he was leaning.  “You seen some things, yeah?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Some weird stuff.  Nothing I can prove.”

“Proof!” he laughed and stood up from under the hood.  “Haunts don’t live like us.  They ain’t gonna leave trace but in your heart, on your mind.  Real though.  As much as you and me.”

“What makes you think one is chasing me?”

“You think it.  You already know that, as good as said so.  But the truth?  I see it on you, like it waitin’ behind you.  Watching you, pushing you places you don’t know, maybe don’t want to go.”

I felt cold.  “What do I?”

“Now you’re asking a good question.  All up to you.  But I tell you what can help.”

“Please.”

“Laugh.  Whatever’s after you not gonna stop.  Probably gonna make you go places, make you see things.  You gotta laugh.  You ain’t so important.  Live or die, everything’ll still go on.  You laugh, it won’t scare you so bad.  Maybe it won’t push you so hard.  You don’t, it’s gonna try to break you.  Just how they do.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You will.”

He closed the hood and walked with me out the garage door, reached up the the chain to pull it closed.  When he was done, I extended my hand.  “Thanks for talking to me.”

He took it.  “No trouble.”  He looked away like he was considering something.  When he turned back, his face was serious.  “Something else.  I don’t know what it means, almost don’t want to say.  But I don’t think you’re only troubled by one.”

Mallory was on the same bench by the time I got back, a few pictures taken.  She held the camera up for me and flipped through them on the digital view finder.  I nodded and agreed they were nice.  She’d had a drink too, I could smell it, but she seemed sober enough.  We stood up and walked along the cobblestone streets, the late afternoon sun warm on our faces.  I didn’t talk much, Mallory didn’t ask.  More people were beginning to be out and about in the streets, restaurants and bars beginning to open their doors for the evening, setting out tables.  Eventually Mallory spoke.

“I guess your mechanic had something to say.  You’ve been too quiet for him to have just blown you off.”

“Yeah.”

“You want to talk about it?”

“I’m not sure.”

“Was it anything helpful?”

“Hard to tell.  I think maybe it just made me more nervous.”

“What’d he say?”

“That the spirits sometimes look back at you if you start looking for them too hard.”

“What spirits?”

I paused.  “You want to get a drink?  I could use a drink.”

She shook her head.  “In a minute.  What spirits did he mean?”

“I don’t know.”

She just stared at me.

“You don’t want to hear this.  It’s just the same kind of thing you’re already worried about.”

“Now I definitely want to hear it.  What did you say to him?”

I looked around, there were people going in to a little pub not more than twenty yards from us.  “I’m going for a drink.”  I started walking.  Mallory caught up with me and grabbed my arm, stopping me.

“What did you say?”

“You really want to know?”

“Yes.”

“Fine.  I told him that I’m looking for a goddess, Mallory.  Because I think maybe I am.  I think maybe that’s what we’re doing on this trip.”

She let go of my arm, I think more from surprise than anything else.  “What?”

“I told you, you didn’t want to hear it.  Let’s just drop it, Ok?”

“Chris, what do you mean you think we’re looking for a goddess?  Like some kind of metaphor?  Or like you think the goddess in the journals is, what, allegorical for something?”

I shrugged.  “Maybe.  I don’t really know.  I just… shit.  I’ve read the journals too, Mal.  Just like you said.  And I think the goddess is really what we’re supposed to find.  I think that’s why we’re on this trip.”

She looked at me, her eyes wide with incredulity.  “I don’t know what to say to that.”

“Then don’t.”

“You can’t expect me just to hear that and let it go, do you?”

I started walking again, she kept pace.  “I don’t expect you to do anything, Mallory.  Including believe me.”

“Don’t start on me with that.  I’ve been on the other end of it too many times.”

“Fine.”  We walked, almost to the bar.  “I’m going in.  Are you coming?”

She looked back down the street, then back at me.  “Whatever, sure.”

I went back to see Henri the next morning before Mallory woke up.  I left her a note, but I didn’t feel like fighting about it.  I needed to know what he meant.  He didn’t hesitate when I said the word goddess.  He started talking about spirits like he meant it, and now with the sun coming up and more of the road ahead of us, I couldn’t just hope it would get figured out on its own.  I drove back as best as I could remember, found the shop.  It was open, and there was a man taking information for a customer down on a clipboard.  I waited until they were done, until he walked out with the keys to drive it up into the garage.

“Excuse me.  I’m looking for Henri.  Is he around today?”

“No, Henri left last night.  Visiting his brother in Shreveport.  You need some work done, I can take care of it for you.”

“Damn.  No, that’s fine.  I’d just spoken with him yesterday, I’d hoped to catch up with him again.”

“You sure?  If it’s about your car there, we can handle it just as well.”

“No, I’m sorry.  It wasn’t about my car, just something he said.  Do you know when he’ll be back?”

“Don’t know, about a week, maybe.  His brother’s been sick.”

“Alright.  Thanks anyway.”

He half-turned back toward the garage, then paused and looked back at me.  “Wait… is your name Chris?”

“Yeah.”

“You talked to him yesterday about… well, some of his weird shit?”

I nodded.  “Yeah, you could say that.”

“Hold on, then, he left something for you.”  He went back into the office, unlocked the desk and pulled out an envelope.  He walked back out, little bell on the door ringing both times.  “Here.”

I took it.  “Thanks.  What is it?”

He shrugged.  “Don’t know, don’t want to know.  Henri deals in some strange things now and then.  You involved, fine, you take it, but I don’t need to know.”

“Ok.  Thanks again.”

He nodded but didn’t answer, walked to a customer car and drove it up into the garage.  I got back in my car and drove to the hotel.  I didn’t go back in the room, just sat outside in the car, looking down at the envelope.  There was a bit of weight to it, and a rustling sound, like something heavier was in there with the paper.  I turned the car off and opened the envelope.  There was a key taped to a piece of paper, the paper had a note written on it.

Your ghosts ain’t always been so.

Below the key was an address in Arkansas.  I didn’t know where, I had to get out the map to figure it out.  Looked like it was in the north western part of the state, near a river and the Ozarks.
