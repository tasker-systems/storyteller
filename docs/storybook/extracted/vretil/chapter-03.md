“Any idea what happened?”

I’d come over straight from work.  I still smelled like grease, my pants wet with dishwater, my shirt stinking of sweat.  I looked around Mike’s office.  A diploma on the wall, a shelf of medical books, the DSM IV on his desk.  Through the blinds of his window I could look down and see a little gated garden lined with brick, situated near the doctor’s parking lot.  Disparity made for distance.  I shifted in my seat and looked over at him.

“I don’t know.  She was fine on Monday.”

“Any unusual stressors, anything unexpected that she would have had to deal with?”  He had her file flipped open, but he wasn’t reading it.  Dr. Nelson had known Mallory and I for years, and didn’t really need to look over the details of her history.

“I don’t think so.  She doesn’t always tell me.”

He nodded.  “Well, we can hold her for seventy-two hours, either way.  We’ll try to find out if this signals a real downturn, or if, hopefully, it was just a bad day.”

I shrugged.  “Yeah.  Call me, I guess, let me know.”

“I will.”

I stood up.  “Thanks, Mike.”

I was turning to leave, but he called me back.  “Chris?”

“Yeah?”

“How about you?  How are you doing with all this?”

“Me?  Alright, I guess.  Why?”

He stood up and walked around his desk, leaning against the side.  “Because this is as hard on loved ones as it is on the patients.  Harder, sometimes.”  He looked me in the eye.  “I want you to know there are people you can talk to.  Groups for families, for people like you who have to try to hold the pieces together for someone else.  You don’t have to be alone with it.”

I smiled, shook my head.  “I know.  Not my thing, though.  Thanks.”

He nodded.  “I understand.  But you need talk to someone.  No one can do this on their own.”  He smiled.  “Bother a stranger if you have to.”

I laughed, waved, and walked out the door.

Your parents are gone, son.  I barely remember the words, to be honest.  More that I’ve heard the story and created a memory around it than any real recollection.  Mom and dad died before I was really old enough understand it, or remember much of it.  I could remember the words terrible accident, but mostly I remembered Mallory crying.  Tears on her face are probably the first real memory I have.  It had meant something to her when she heard it, and if I didn’t remember the pain it caused me, I remember what it caused her.  Waking up nights to hear her softly sobbing, not really understanding enough to do more than curl up next to her and try to soothe.  She was older than me, enough so that adapting to a different kind of life had been hard on her.  I never really knew any other life.  But Mallory had a mother, once.

For all the horror stories you hear, we did alright.  We didn’t get split up, and in the end John and Maria took us in, a nice older couple who had already fostered a few kids.  We’d been in the system for a while by then.  Mallory wasn’t looking to imprint on yet another set of parents.  Still, they gave us somewhere steady to be while we were teenagers, somewhere to come home to.  For me it was enough.  For Mallory it was just a detour before she could finally get away for good.

College was going to be her whole life.  A new one in front of her, different enough from the last that she could leave it wholly behind.  Hoping she could leave behind dead parents and foster homes and a life that wasn’t supposed to have been hers, finding somewhere better finally to be.  Someone better to be.  And it was the right thing for her, school was something she was good at.  Reading and learning and studying were things she could excel in, things she could drift off into and be away, her single and solitary refuge.  It was safe in her head, alone, a book the silent companion and portal to somewhere else, to something else.  She got a full ride to a school upstate, and by the time she got her acceptance letter, she was already gone.  We bought her a greyhound ticket and we hugged on the steps and waved goodbye as it pulled away from the terminal.  And that was supposed to be that.

All in all, it was as it should have been for a few years.  I finished high school while living with John and Maria.  I’d drive up to see Mallory once in a while, though as time passed we had less in common.  She was interested in topics I didn’t understand, passionate about things I’d never heard of.  She’d come home for holidays and we’d try to spend time together, though you could see she really just wanted to get back.  She got financial aid and work study so she could stay through the summers and take classes.  That was home for her, more than John and Maria’s house had ever been.  I couldn’t blame her.  She was the one who was going to be something.  She was the one who was going to do something important.  That I drifted through the end of graduation, my first few jobs without any real sense of where I wanted to go didn’t trouble me much.  It wasn’t up to me to be someone that mattered.

I got a call late one night during her third year.  Her roommate was on the phone, upset, her voice at the edge of frantic, telling me that Mallory wouldn’t stop crying, wouldn’t stop talking to herself.  Wouldn’t really respond to anyone else, either.  She put me on the phone with her but I couldn’t get much out of her either way.  What she did say didn’t make much sense.  I called in sick to work the next day and drove up to see her, but her roommate had to point me to the emergency room.  Mallory had cut herself pretty badly.  By the time I got there she was laughing, smiling in her hospital gown, sorry about the fuss, the confusion.  Saying she was fine, that it had been a misunderstanding, that it wasn’t anything serious.

But it was, and it got worse.  Her grades began to suffer, she dropped the clubs she’d been involved in, abandoned the friends she’d made.  She started complaining to me of professors that were being suddenly unfair to her, of people who were talking behind her back.  She started suspecting her roommate of conspiring against her, of snooping on her computer, reading emails, sabotaging homework.  Eventually her roommate moved out.  Within a few months things had degraded beyond recognition.  Though rarely violent to others, during a dispute about a grade she lashed out, stuck a pencil in a professor’s hand.  She got suspended, then put on probation.  She tried to kill herself for real after that, and spent a few months in the state hospital for observation.

A diagnosis came back, somewhere between relief and horror.  The calm of a death sentence.  We could have fought to keep her in school, but she wasn’t able.  She broke down and moved back home, got on disability.  The state started sending checks, though it wasn’t really enough to live on.  They covered rent, and she got food stamps, but there wasn’t much more.  I put in what I could to cover utilities and other necessities as they came up.  I tried working extra jobs, but it just got me fired or let go more often from the ones I could get, conflicting schedules, showing up late and tired.  Ended up working in kitchens, sometimes as a cook, sometimes just a guy in the back, cleaning dishes, digging forks out of the garbage, putting complimentary bread sticks in the oven.  Taking whatever I could get, so long as I could hold on to it easily enough, or replace it with like without too much effort.

I drove home from the appointment at the hospital, went inside, turning on the television for noise.  I put a frozen dinner in the microwave, and stood there in the kitchen just staring across the countertop to the living room.  Unfocused, thoughts on autopilot, as absent as I could be without watching me abandon myself and walk out the door.  The phone rang and startled me, I shook myself awake and answered.

“Hello?”

“Hey, son, it’s John.”

“Hey.”

“Mike called, said Mallory had another episode.  He was trying to get in touch with you.  Did he?”

“Yeah, he called me at work.”

“Good.  Is she going to be alright?”

“They don’t know yet.  I hope so.”

“How about you?  Are you Ok?”

“Good enough.  A little tired, I guess.  I think my boss might be close to firing me, probably tired of me leaving early, not showing up.”

“Well, what does he expect?  You have Mallory to look after.”

“I don’t think he much cares.”

“That’s not fair.”

I smiled in spite of myself.  “Thanks, John.”

It was silent for a moment, when he spoke again his voice was quieter, more sincere.  “Is there anything I can do, Chris?  For you or Mallory?”

“Not unless you’re somehow suddenly rich.”

“I’m sorry, Chris.  I wish I could do more.  It’s just that my pension barely covers me and Maria as it is.”

“I know, John.  I’m just kidding, we’re doing alright.”  I cleared my throat.  “Anyway, sorry to rush you off, but my dinner’s almost ready.  I’m gonna eat and watch a little TV, maybe get to bed early tonight.”

“Yeah, of course.”  He paused.  “Oh, I almost forgot.  A package came for you.”

“What, over there?”

“Yeah.”

“Who sent it?”

“I don’t know, there’s no name on it, no return address.  Just addressed to you, doesn’t even have any postage on it, like it was hand delivered.”

“Why would anyone do that?”

“I don’t really know.”  He was quiet for a moment, as if considering, but seemed to think better of it.  “Would you rather I dropped it off or mailed it to you?”

“Don’t worry about it.  I’ve got some errands to run after work on that side of town tomorrow, anyway.  I’m working the morning and afternoon shifts, but I can probably drop by about six or so to pick it up, if you’re gonna be around.”

“Yeah, I’ll be here.”

“Alright.  I’ll get it then, if that works for you.”

“Sure thing, son.”

Late afternoon sun was reflecting off of John’s truck as I pulled into the driveway.  Maria’s car was gone, and I parked in her space.  I knocked but no one answered, tried the door but it was locked.  Thought John might be in his greenhouse, decided to walk around the side to see.  I pushed through gate of the privacy fence, John’s dog was on the back porch, head down between his paws, chin just over the edge of the wood, his eyes gazing tiredly out over the grass.  He heard me coming and lifted his head, tail swishing lazily across the wood.  I sat down on the porch next to him and scratched his ears, patted his side.  He lifted his chin and rested it on my leg, and I could see John in the greenhouse, pruning a plant.  I leaned back and looked up at the trees.  A breeze was playing among the branches, making the sunlight fracture and shatter across the ground between the shadows, little movements like a kaleidoscope of yellow and brown and green.  It was warm and quiet, I laid back on the porch, the wood slats dimpling my back, rust of nails corroding off onto my hands.  A few minutes later I heard the squeaking spring of the greenhouse door open, John’s footsteps as he walked out.  I didn’t look up, my gaze lost among the trees.

“What do they tell you, son?”

I smiled, sitting up.  “Hey, John.”

He clapped me on the shoulder and took the step up to the porch, walking toward the house.  “C’mon in.  Let me get cleaned up.”

I followed him into the kitchen, he walked around to the sink and began to wash his hands.  I sat down on a barstool near the counter, looking at the little house around me.  Glass display cases in the living room holding Maria’s collectible plates, mail order dolls, and commemorative buttons.  A bowl of real fruit on the kitchen table, little stitched praying hands and Bible verses hung on the walls.  Pictures of the kids, like Mallory and me, that had lived here over the years, placed around the mantle of the fireplace.  John turned the water off and picked up a towel.

“Let me get that package for you.”

“Thanks.”

“Of course.  Strange they sent it here though.  You still have any friends from back then?”

I smiled.  Seemed like I scarcely had any friends from right now.  “No, not that I can think of.  None that would send me anything here, anyway.”

John walked into the side room.  He and Maria used it as a kind of office, though it ended up as more of a storage space for debris with nowhere else to go.  I heard him move some papers around and the sound of something falling to the floor.  He swore a little, had a grin on his face when he came back out, holding the package.

“Maria manages to stack every new piece of junk right on top of every other piece in piles so high that you need an engineer to get things down without tumbling everything else.”

I laughed.  He handed me a box wrapped in brown paper.  It just had my name on it, a bit of scotch tape holding the paper in place.

I stood back up.  “Thanks, John.  I’ll get out of your hair.”

“Why don’t you stay, son?  I was just about to eat dinner.  Are you hungry?”

“A little.”

“I’ve got leftovers.  Nothing fancy, but you’re welcome to it.”

“I don’t know.  I should probably get home.”

“You sure?  Maria’s going to be up at choir practice till after eight.  I wouldn’t mind the company.”

I looked at him standing there, lonely like growing old.  Other than Mallory and me, the foster kids had all moved away.  His brother died a few years back, it had made me cry watching him put his brother in the ground.  Asking me to stay for dinner, he wasn’t begging, no desperation or lack of dignity, just too much solitude with too little outlet.  Years of his life poured into a family that was never his by more than proxy.  I was tired and wanted to get home, but I nodded and relented.

“Yeah, sure.  That’d be great.”

He brightened.  “Good.”  He turned and pulled out something from the fridge, punching numbers on the microwave.  “How’s work going?  On the phone it sounded like you might be having some trouble.”

“It’s alright.  I’ll get something else if it falls through.”

He nodded, paused for a moment.  “You know you can do better than those jobs, Chris.”

I shrugged.  “I guess.”

“You could still go to school.  Your sister’s not the only smart one between you.”

I laughed.  “College doesn’t really seem like me.”

“I don’t see why not.”

He pulled out some bread and cut a few pieces, putting a little tub of butter on the table next to it.  I took a piece.  “Anyway, I don’t really have the money.  And Mal needs me.”

He didn’t answer, just nodded slowly.  “You seeing anyone right now?”

“Not really.  Nothing serious.”

“Any plan to make it serious?”

I laughed.  “I don’t know.  Guess I haven’t really thought about it.”

He took a piece of bread, put some butter on it.  He looked back over at me.  “You can’t live your whole life for her, Chris.  You know that.”

“I know.”

The microwave beeped, he took the plate out.  We had dinner and a couple of beers, talking in the kitchen as the sun went down.

It was later than I would have liked by the time I got home, and I was tired.  It could be hard to talk to John.  He knew enough about Mallory that I could share a little, but not enough to be honest in a way that would have helped me.  He wasn’t ready to hear about watching her vomit from an overdose of pills, or about walking in to find her bloody with slit wrists.  I couldn’t tell him that sometimes I hated her as much as I loved, and that I wished in fleeting moments that she was no longer a burden I had to bear, a problem I couldn’t solve.  Talking to him was a game of measuring and maintaining distance, close enough not to offend or excite inquiry, but far enough away to protect him from what he couldn’t handle knowing.

And for me it was hard to talk about hope, to hear him reaffirm a positive outlook for her long term prognosis.  Telling me how she would stabilize and lead a healthy, fulfilling life.  That one day the doctors would find the right balance of medication, that she would find a way to live that made her happy.  He wanted to believe it.  I suppose I did too, in my way.  But his hope of it was as much for his own benefit as hers, though there was nothing wrong with that either.  We cope how we can.  Refuting his fantastic futures would be cruel, in service only to a harder truth I felt I knew.  I didn’t harbor the same hopes he did.

I showered and fell down on the couch, my head resting back against the cushions.  They still smelled faintly of cigarettes; the previous owner had smoked, cushions had never entirely lost the smell.  The box I’d picked up from John was on the coffee table where I’d set it, almost forgotten.  The TV was muted, flickering in the background, and I sat up, looking at the package.  It seemed forbidding, just my name.  Like it was a bomb or dead animal.  I tore the paper back and unwrapped the box.

Inside were a few stacks of photographs held together with rubber bands, and beneath them a few spiral-bound notebooks.  I lifted the photographs out, set them on the coffee table, and pulled out the notebooks.  At the bottom of the box there was a single photograph, taped into the center, obviously placed there intentionally.  It was of an old woman, the back of her head and long gray hair, the rest of her naked back down to her buttocks, wrinkled skin and liver marks.  She was somewhere dark.  The only light was from the flash; it illuminated her, and only a few paces beyond.  The ground looked like red dirt, and in it were traced strange symbols.  She held a knife in one hand, the other was bloody.  I picked it up and turned it over.  On the back, there were four words, written neatly and centered in the space.  She waits for you.

I picked up the rest of the photographs and unwound the rubber bands.  I flipped through them one at a time, a rising sense of anxiety, even fear.  These were photographs of me, as a child.  Too many of them.  Photographs I didn’t remember, taken in places I hadn’t been, and with a woman I didn’t know.  She was tall, her hair dark and loose.  Her eyes were sharp, and when they flashed into the camera it was as if they saw me holding the photograph, whatever the distance and time between.  In the photographs, my younger self was standing in strange poses and postures, arms twisted up or down, holding trinkets, and staring at things far off.  But somberly, there seemed to be nothing of play or laughter.  Her eyes were hard and mine were empty.  There were photographs of words written on what must have been my palm or hers, but they meant nothing to me.  There were dates on the backs of some, but they didn’t mean anything to me either.

I felt a shiver of alarm down my back.  I couldn’t help but turn to look around me and behind, as if I was suddenly stalked by someone or something.  The photographs were impossible.  As a child I hadn’t lived in any one home long enough for the photographs to have been taken over so broad a range of dates, not without someone having followed my progress from home to home.  And the photographs had not all been taken in the same place.  There were photographs of mountains and photographs of rivers and photographs of deserts.  In some I was standing on red boulders, in others green hills, in different seasons under different skies.  But most, I didn’t know the woman.  I had never seen her before.  If she had so often taken me to places this remote, I should have some recollection, some flicker of recognition of her face.  I had none.

Mallory was nowhere to be seen.  We weren’t easily parted when we were kids, and I would have remembered this kind of separation.  If she was present, why was she absent from the film?  Who had taken the photographs, or was it only oblivious strangers, snapping surreal photos of an eccentric mother and child?  I picked up a notebook, flipping through, hoping to find some context.  I could make little sense of them.  I opened the rest, glancing at pages.  They seemed to be journals, though some without obvious dates.  They made no more sense than the photographs.  I found what I believed was the first, flipped it open, and read the first entry.

Epistle Five, that you might know them.

Beings of Fire, for if there are gods, these are not as I had known them, and if angels, not sent with some benevolence to man.  Something before or after, divine by dint of fire and magick, ignorant of all entreaty or prayer.  Living flame like glyphs of information and meaning, licking sensuous tongues of blazing fire, from faces and hands and skin, eyes as darkling gemstones, an infinite set of stars flickering in their depths, as if all space was not reflected, but contained, within. Demonic legion, moving with equal grace among those angelic of bliss and wonder, all terrible, inhuman, of a scale and mode of thought so alien to man as to be incommunicable to him.  Not of his self-same space, but beyond, no compassion, but perhaps a piercing love, no forgiveness but the purity of speed.

In the face of this we are insignificant, unimportant, though not without some meaning.  Meaning like information in our construct.  We bear the insignificance of freedom, for we are too small, in the entirety of human history, to alter but by the most incidental ripple the currents of this greater motion in the universe.  Though should we look, we may be as tiny gods, fledgling and half-born, sleeping restively and with discontent in our mother’s womb, yet without capacity or knowledge to do more than writhe, struggling, unwitting of purpose or place, to be free.

It is with this in mind that I begin.  There is a change coming, a storm on the horizon.  War: tyranny and violent resistance indistinguishable; fabrics of social order rent asunder, old patterns crumbling, not quietly, before a more chaotic host of new.  Certainty of nation and person and good or ill beginning to fall, screaming like abandoned identity, away, the old solid ground showing itself a false and failing artifice, even from the beginning.  In the turn of the trumps, we are as those cast from the tower.  But what is misunderstood is that the dust will not settle, that rather it is we ourselves who must change, adapting to the new momentum, the seeming tumult and chaos but the casting off of that which cannot accelerate into the speed of what brilliance as lies before us.

But for all that my heart breaks for the cost, the fear and pain unresolved but by death, the hells created in confusion and, like nightmare unwaking, consuming.  I am not a blazing one, beyond pity or compassion.  In me my heart cries out to the weak and strong alike, each terrified of the coming chaos that even the most blind of us can see, however tightly are eyes screwed shut, however loudly is denial shouted.  Wake for us an intercessor, a psychopomp, a friend to stand with us at the crossroads.  A Holy Guardian Angel to take by the hand those most angry and afraid, and make more gentle this terrible passage.  One who has been with us from the beginning, who, without flinching has recorded every word and deed, who has been scribe to our histories - grand or petty, blessed or damned - and can love us still.  Who can take in hand the chains of history and identity and, like so much chaff, burn them from us, that free we might begin as infant things of fire, new, to see.

I didn’t know what to make of it, and I sat still for a long time on the couch, thinking.

I called John the next morning.  I didn’t know what I hoped he’d be able to tell me, only I knew I needed help, that this was beyond me.  It seemed most likely that these journals and photographs must be a hoax, but it didn’t comfort me any more than the idea that they were not.  I explained as much as I could over the phone, asked him to meet me.  He said he was heading to a park to take a walk, but that I could meet him there.  I agreed, and left.  He was sweating when I found him, sitting on a bench.  He smiled at me when I walked up, waved but didn’t stand.

I waved back.  “How was the walk?”

“Good.  Made this old man tired.”

I smiled.  “Thanks for meeting me.”

“Sure.  Hope I can help.”

“Really, anything you can think of would be more than what I’ve got right now.”

I set the box down between us, flipped open the lid and handed him a stack of photographs.  He wiped his hands off on a towel around his neck before taking them, adjusted his glasses.  He looked through a few before glancing back up at me.  “Do you know this woman?”

“I don’t.”  He nodded, turned through a few more.

I asked, “Do you recognize her?  Anything in the photographs?”

“No.  These all look like they were taken before you came to live with us.”

“I think they were.”

He handed the stack back to me.  “What’s this about?”

“I don’t know.”

“On the phone, you said these were from that package yesterday?”

“Yeah.”

“Well, was there a letter?  Anything to explain it?”

“No, just photographs, and these notebooks.”

“Do the notebooks say anything helpful?”

“I don’t know, really.  I haven’t had time to read all of them, just bits and pieces.  They seem like volumes of a journal, maybe.  Someone writing religious stuff down.”

“Why?”

“No idea.  I guess I was hoping you might recognize something, that it would give me a place to start.”

He shook his head.  “None of it looks familiar.  Honestly, I think someone’s playing some kind of prank on you.  Or running some kind of scam or something.”

“I think so too.  I don’t see how it could be anything else.  But I don’t know why.”

John nodded slowly, picking up a journal and opening it.  He read for a few minutes, then set it back down in the box with the rest.

“Doesn’t make sense.  Why go to this kind of trouble?”

“I don’t know, that’s what I keep thinking, too.  And that even if it was some kind of hoax, it’s not a friendly one.  It feels more like a threat than a joke.”

“I agree.”  He was quiet for a moment, thinking.  He looked back over at me.  “I think maybe you should go to the police.  Maybe other people have gotten this kind of thing, and there’s a record of it.”

“Maybe.”

We talked for a while longer, but without any other ideas.  It was either a hoax or it wasn’t, though neither sat well with me.  Either way seemed dangerous.

Three days went by and I was with Doctor Nelson in his office while he signed Mallory’s release paperwork.  When he was finished he scratched out a prescription, tore it off the pad and handed it to me.

“I want to try something a little different with your sister’s medication.”

“Anything I should keep an eye on?”

“Not specifically.  Just try to get her to take it.”

“I’ll try.  Don’t know how much good it’ll do.”

“I know.  Try though, if you can.”  He paused, but I didn’t answer.  Mallory never ran her decisions by me, there wasn’t much I could really do but nag at her.  That rarely produced the intended result.  He continued.  “Anyway, I’ll have someone fill it for you before you leave.”

“Thanks.”  I glanced down at the slip, then back up at him.  “How’s she doing?”

He walked around his desk.  “She seems better.  More lucid now.”

“Good.”

He paused for a moment, cleared his throat.  He looked over at me, his expression more concerned.  “Can I ask you a question?”

“Sure.”

“When you two were kids… Were any of the homes you lived in particularly religious?”

“What do you mean?”

He shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Were any of the parents very devout?  Fundamentalist, anything like that?”

I shook my head.  “Not really.  Church on Sunday sometimes.  Christmas, Easter, that kind of thing.”

“Ok.”

“Why?”

He hesitated.  “When your sister came in this time, she was saying some pretty strange things.”

“Like what?”

“I don’t remember the specifics, exactly.  It’s just that usually her fixations are based around paranoia.  Someone that’s out to get her, a rule being followed or broken to antagonize her personally.  Things like that.”  I didn’t answer.  He leaned against his desk.  “This time it was religious.  On its own I guess that’s not really that unusual, plenty of patients end up with some kind of religious mania.  For all I know, this was that.  But your sister’s never manifested any symptoms like it before.  And the things she was saying were intense.  Apocalyptic.”

I didn’t answer.  He must have seen my face though because he changed his tone.

“I’m sorry.  I’m not trying to worry you.  I probably made that sound pretty bad.”

“Yeah, a little.”

“I was just wondering if you know whether or not she’s been reading any religious literature recently.  Maybe gotten involved with something online.”

“I don’t know.  If so, she didn’t tell me about it.”

He shrugged.  “It might be nothing… the content of a delusion isn’t always related to the illness, at least not directly.”

“Is it serious?  Should I be watching for it?”

“It might be.  It might not be, too, I just don’t know yet.  I know that’s not as reassuring as it could be.  You’ll recognize it if it happens, though, it’s not the kind of thing you’d miss.  If it does happen again, let me know.  Whatever it means, it’ll indicate she’s probably not taking her medication.”

“I try to make sure she does.  I can’t really make her do anything she doesn’t want to, and I can’t be there 24/7.”

“I know.  You do what you can.  A lot of patients don’t have someone as dedicated as you to help them out.  She’s lucky.”

I shrugged.  “I guess.”

“She is.”

We walked toward the admitting office, I saw Mallory push through double doors and walk out.  She waved at me, flashing a quick, tight smile.  She looked thin.  Her skin was pale, her hair seeming darker than usual against it.  Her lips were pressed and she seemed tired.  “Hey.”

I smiled back, but worry crept in at the edges, unwilling to be kept out.  “Hey.  How are you?”

“I’m Ok.”

She walked to the glass of the admitting window, they slid a little box of her belongings through.  She picked up her cell phone, keys, and the rest.  I gave her a hug, she hugged me lightly back, not pulling away but not committing.  I let her go.  “You ready?”

She nodded.  “Yeah.”

I held up the prescription.  “We need to get this filled first.”

“Ok.”

Doctor Nelson turned and walked with us, putting his hand on Mallory’s arm.  She didn’t withdraw it, but she seemed tense.  He said, “You’re going to be alright.”

She smiled weakly, but looked away, down at the floor tiles where we walked.  I slipped my hand down and threaded my fingers through hers, she grabbed them tightly.  We walked toward the pharmacy, which was on the way out, no one saying anything more until we reached it.  I took the script and handed it to the pharmacist, leaning against the counter while Mike spoke quietly to Mallory.

“I’m putting you on something a little different this time.  Might help some of the grogginess you said was bothering you.”

“Thank you.”

He looked at her more seriously.  “I know the side effects are hard.  I can’t pretend I wouldn’t want to stop taking them if I had to go through the same thing.  But you’ve got to try, Mallory.  We can get this to where it’s manageable, if you stay on the medication.  You don’t have to end up back here.”

“I know.”

He reached up and squeezed her shoulder.  She stood stiff and unmoving, her eyes fixed on the floor beyond him.  He patted her arm and took a step back toward me, looked in at the pharmacist.  “Everything set here?”

The pharmacist answered, “Should be.”

Mike nodded, shook my hand again before leaving.  “I’ve got to go.  If you need anything, give me a call, Ok?”

“I will.”

We were in the car on the way home, though Mallory wasn’t speaking, her eyes lost out the window.  We had made this drive together what seemed like a hundred times.  Enough that it seemed almost normal.

I glanced over at her.  “Do you want to talk about anything?”

She shook her head slowly.  “Not really.”

“Is there anything going on that I should know about?”

“No.”

We drove quietly for a few more minutes.  “I’m not upset with you.  You know that, right?”

She didn’t turn from the window, her voice quiet.  “Yeah.”

“Mike said you were pretty upset yourself though, when you came in.  Said it sounded religious, like scripture or something.  What was that about?”

“Nothing.”

I hesitated for a moment.  “You sure?”

She turned her head toward me.  “I don’t know what to say.  It didn’t feel like it was me.”

“What do you mean?”

She shook her head, turned back to the window.  “Nothing.”

I let it go, drove for a few more minutes quietly.  “Are you hungry?”

“Not really.”

“You look like you should be.  I’m hungry.  Do you mind if we stop somewhere?”

“No.”

We drove to an Italian place up the road and parked in the back.  The streetlamp was flickering but not throwing any light.  It was quiet, she stopped before we went in, pulling a pack of cigarettes out of her purse.

“Mind if I have one first?”

“Not at all.”

I leaned against the hood of the car, and she joined me.  A quick flicker of firelight, then smoke drifting up in front of us, wisps of it lacing the split darkness where the building stopped and the sky began.  I watched quietly.

After a few moments, she spoke in a muted voice.  “I appreciate you picking me up again.  I know it’s a hassle.”

“You’d do it for me.”

She laughed.  “Not really the same is it, willing versus doing?”

I smiled.  “I guess not.”

She was quiet for a moment.  Glow of red embers from her cigarette.  “The things I was saying while being brought in.  I don’t know what they were.”

“Were you taking your meds?”

She was quiet.

“I’m not trying to lecture you.  I’m just asking.”

Her voice was barely audible.  “I know.”

I was quiet for a minute and looked over at her.  “I can’t pretend to know, Mal.  Not what it’s like, or what the medication does to you.  I’m not trying to preach.  But Mike says it’s really important that you stay on them.”

“I know.”

I didn’t say anything else.  I didn’t know what to say.  She flicked the last of the ash of the cigarette to the ground, and said “I’m sorry.”

I reached down and bumped her arm with my elbow, trying to smile.  “Let’s just go eat.”

She nodded, and stood up.  “Ok.”

We walked around the corner of the building.  The door opened as someone came out, and there were the sounds of people talking and laughing, glasses and silverware clinking.  Mallory put her hand on my arm, stopped me.  “Chris… can we just go home?  I’m sorry.  I thought I was feeling up to it, but I’m not.”

I looked back at her.  “Are you sure?  It’s just some pasta and garlic bread.  We’ll be in and out in less than an hour.”

She looked at me anxiously.  “I know.  Chris, please?  I’ll make it up to you, maybe we can do it this weekend instead.”

I shrugged.  “Alright, yeah.”

Her head was down. “Thank you.”

I took her home.  We didn’t really talk.  When we pulled into her driveway, she got out, and I leaned across the seat before she shut the door, looking out through the passenger window to see her.  “Call me tonight before you go to sleep, Ok?  Just to let me know you’re alright.”

“I will.  I’m sorry again.”

“It’s no big deal.  We’ll do lunch on Sunday or something.”

“Ok.”

I stayed in the driveway until I saw her unlock the door and flip on a light inside.  When I got home that night and sat in the driveway for a little while, thinking.  I couldn’t have said what about, thoughts in my head that wouldn’t be still.  Help that wouldn’t come to solve problems too far beyond me.  A madness in my sister’s head that wouldn’t mend.  The weight of a life unlived pressing on me from behind, standing in askance of my every decision, caught between impotence and obligation.  I stared at the garage door in front of my apartment, looking at the peeling paint and cracked concrete of the driveway.  The paint was gray and the concrete was gray and the sky seemed always gray.  I felt sometimes like my eyes had stopped seeing individual things, like instead there was just an immense and immeasurable featureless wall extending forever in all directions.  That I was just something small and tired standing in front of it, nowhere to go, nothing more I could do.  Empty like a scream that had long ago run out of breath and hung silently in the air, unanswered.
