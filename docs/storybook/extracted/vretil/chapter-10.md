Epistle Thirteen, to be lost.

My heart aches, beloved, for beneath your feet now there is no more path.  What is dark and treacherous has come and has taken you unawares.  There was no snare but you have fallen to its trap the same.

Wander here into my darkened wood, I will be with you as I was in the beginning, and shall be at the end.  But you will be alone for all my kindness and caress.

You have ever been the sacrifice, but she the one to bleed.  There was never any truth between you that did not rest on this.  There is no step forward, nor any back now, no light to guide in the sky, all obscured by fog and twisting trees.  Memory like history, becoming fragile and easily tattered.  What has been?  What may yet be, but you cannot ask it now, you have not the words to say.  Yours is only a lost voice, a child crying in the dark, and I with my liar’s lamp to guide your way.  For your sorrow I can offer you no balm but the thought that all that has been may not one day be, and as such a spirit locked by history perhaps you can, as she rises, caught up in the sky, be free.

To have such a fate as transubstantiation, but it will not be my own.  Should she unmake the world I fear mine will remain, and I may never know what glories I have toiled so long to prepare.  Moses, I have struck the stone.  Lament with me, brother, for such punishment as this.  What faith can withstand the dark of night, when night comes so often and again?  What hope, when it is but a child and some sorry misery upon which we must see it pinned?  I have loved her only more than I have hated.  And at the end I have not faith, but the trail of these my many acts, to commend me at my death.

-----

At first I just waited.  I thought she must have gone to get ice, to take a walk.  But half an hour went by and she hadn’t come back, so I called her cell.  She didn’t answer.  I went to look for her, but she wasn’t by the car, and her stuff was gone.  No bags, nothing, just a suitcase of mine, the tent, and two sleeping bags.  I picked up the flashlight and walked around the back of the hotel, circled the building hoping to find her having a cigarette, something.  She wasn’t there.  I went back to the room, looked around for a note, anything to hint where she’d gone, if she’d be back.  I didn’t find anything.  I called the front desk, beginning to feel desperate.

“Can I help you?”

“Hi, yeah.  I’m staying here with my sister.  I fell asleep for a little while and now she’s not in the room.  Did she… I don’t know, did she come by the office, leave me a message or anything?”

“Let me check.”  There was a pause.  “No, there are no messages noted.  Is everything alright, sir?”

I looked around the room.  “I don’t know.”  I thought for a moment.  If she’d left, she didn’t have a car.  If she was heading home she’d need a way to get there.

“Did someone call for a cab in the last few hours?”

“More than one person, yes sir.”

“Any of them a young woman, about thirty, dark hair?”

“Possibly.  I wasn’t paying close attention, to be honest.  Someone else was handling that earlier.”

I paused, trying to think.  “Is there a bus or train station in town?”

“A bus station, yes.”

“Ok.  If she comes back and is looking for me, can you tell her to call my cell?”

“Yes sir.”  There was a pause.  “Do you think something’s wrong?  Should I call the police?”

“No.  I don’t know.  Let me try her at the bus station.  We fought.  Maybe she’s trying to leave.”

I got the address and directions from the attendant, scrawled a quick note in case she came back, and stuck it in the hotel room door.  I tried to call her again but it went straight to voicemail.  I got in the car and drove.

She wouldn’t do this, was the thought I had over and over.  We’d fight.  We’d disagree and not speak to one another for days maybe.  But she wouldn’t just leave, not without saying something.  I don’t know if I was more afraid or angry that she’d leave like this.

I don’t remember driving, I don’t remember the road, but I managed to get to the bus station.  It was small, a few people sitting outside this late - insane, addict, homeless.  A neon light was on too bright over the single bench against the outside wall.  I walked past a few people huddled together, eyes staring at me without even curiosity, blank looks expecting nothing, concerned with little more.  Defeated and nowhere to go.  I felt a hideous kind of kinship, as if but for a chance turn so too would I be, alone and numb and desperate, watching facade people with my own empty eyes.  I couldn’t tell if in my strange state I felt more or less of their humanity, but there was animal empathy in me as if I was but a beast, and they some like denizen.

I walked into the lobby, looked at the board for departures.  There were no busses headed east leaving for another hour, none that had left within the last two.  I walked up to the clerk.

“I’m looking for my sister.  I was wondering if she bought a ticket.”

“Not allowed to say, sir.  Privacy rules and all that.”

I paused.  “Ok.  Maybe you can just tell me if you saw her?  About thirty, dark hair, thin.”

“No.”

“No you didn’t see anyone like that?”

“I didn’t.  Can’t tell you anyway.  Maybe you’re an abusive boyfriend or something, right?  How can I know?  I’m not allowed to tell you.”

I was frustrated, and leaned in more closely.  “Look, please…  I’m her brother.  She’s on medication, and she’s not very stable sometimes.  I’m just worried about her.  I want to know if she got on a bus, or if she’s planning to.  I’m not even going to stop her, Ok?  I just need to know if she’s alright.”

“I’m sorry, sir.  I don’t know.”

I looked around the lobby, there was an old couple sitting down on a bench.  I glared for a minute at the clerk and walked over to them.

“Excuse me.”

The old man looked up.  “Yes?”

“I’m sorry to bother you, but I’m looking for my sister.  I was wondering if you saw her come through here, by any chance.  Slender girl, about my age, dark hair.”

“Oh, I don’t know.  Can’t say as I was looking.”  He nudged his wife.  “Dear, you see a girl like that?”

The old woman shook her head, looked at me.  “I’m sorry child, I didn’t.  But there haven’t been too many people through here tonight.  I think I would have seen her.”

“Ok.”

The old woman patted my hand.  “We’ll keep an eye out.”

“Thank you.”

There was only the one bus leaving in the next few hours heading east.  I decided to see if maybe she showed up and got on.  I sat down across the lobby from the bus entrance, and I waited.  People began to slowly trickle in, buying tickets.  The time came and went, the bus filled up and pulled away.  She didn’t show.  I drove back to the hotel, checked with the attendant, but she hadn’t come back.  My note in the door was still there where I left it.  I called her cellphone again, sent a text as well.  I knew we’d fought.  I knew I had been pushing her too far, too close to where she’d stop wanting to push back.  But I didn’t think we’d gotten there yet.  Now that we had I didn’t know what to do.

I waited until it would be six in the morning back home to call John.

“Hi, I’m sorry to call so early.”

“No, it’s fine, I was just getting up anyway.  What’s going on?”

“Mallory’s missing.”

“What?”

“She was with me, here in Arkansas.  We’ve been driving, like I told you about.  Only she’s gone now, no note or anything, not answering her cell.  She’s just not here anymore.”

He didn’t reply for a moment.  “I don’t know what you mean, Chris.”

“I just… I don’t know.  I don’t think she’d leave without at least telling me where she was going.  She seemed pretty lucid.  I mean, we’d had a fight, so she was mad at me, but…  I guess I was wondering if she called you before she left?”

“Son, you’re not making sense.”

“Mallory’s gone.  Has she called you?”

He paused.  “Where are you?”

“In a hotel, northern part of Arkansas.  We camped in the Ozarks last night.”

He let out a long breath.  “No, you didn’t.  Not both of you.”

“Yeah, we did.  It was nice.”

“Chris, you’re going to want to sit down, I think.  I don’t know how to say this.  You already know it, better than any of us.”

“What’s going on, John?”

He paused for a long time.  Long enough that I almost asked again.  His voice was low, he sounded like he might be near tears.  “Son, Mallory is dead.  She has been for about two months now.  You know it.  You were the one that found her.”

“What?”

“You were the one to find her in her room.  She killed herself, Chris.  Almost two months ago, well before you left on your trip.”

My voice got angry.  “That’s not funny, John.”

“No, it’s not.  You were a pallbearer at the funeral.  So was I.”

“That’s bullshit.  She was here with me.  She’s been on this trip the whole time.”

“I’m sorry, son.  She hasn’t.  You and I, we put her in the ground together.  You know her doctor, Mike Nelson?  He was there.  You can call him and ask if you’d like.  He was as shaken up by it as we all were.  He’d hoped we’d turned this corner with her a long time ago.”

“No, I told you.  I told you that Mallory and I were going on this trip together, before we left.  You didn’t say anything about it then.”

He paused, I could hear him take a deep breath.  “I thought… I don’t know.  I thought you meant in spirit.  I thought maybe you just needed some time to process it all.  I couldn’t imagine that somehow you’d… forgotten.”

“I didn’t forget anything.  I swear to god, she’s been right here.  I bought her a sleeping bag for Christ’s sake.  Rented hotel rooms with two beds.  She’s been my goddamn navigator while we drove.”

“She hasn’t, Chris.  She’s gone.  Somewhere inside you know that.  You should come home.  If you need, I’ll wire you some money, you can get on the next plane.  You need to talk to someone.  Something’s going wrong for you, son.”

“Y’know what, no.  Fuck this.  Fuck you for doing this, it’s not funny.  You’re sick.  I can’t believe I thought you’d help.”  I hung up the phone, sat down on the bed reeling.  I couldn’t believe John would do something like that.  It made no sense.  Why would he lie to me, about that of all things?  Like we hadn’t had enough scares with Mallory, afraid she’d hurt herself or worse.  Finding her with a bottle of pills used up, cuts on her arm.  To make a joke out of it like that was beyond malicious.  It was disturbed.  I stood up, angry, wanting to call him back and scream at him.  I picked up the phone to dial but set it down.  It was unacceptable.  It was beyond unacceptable, it was unforgivable, no amount of yelling would fix it.

I paced back and forth in the little room.  I looked at her bed, it was still made, she must have left before she even bothered to lay down.  I called her cellphone a dozen more times.  I picked up the phone in the room and called the police, but they said I’d have to wait until she’d been missing for twenty-four hours before a report could be filed officially.  Said that most people come back before then, and that I shouldn’t worry.  I worried anyway.  I went back to the hotel office, asked everyone on staff if they’d seen her, to please let me know if they did see her.  I came back to the room exhausted, the hour or two of sleep I got before waking up to find her gone hadn’t been enough, and my adrenaline was wearing down.  I still felt jittery and anxious, burnt like too many amphetamines, eyes bloodshot, nervous and beginning to feel the cold of paranoia on me.  What if John was in on this whole thing with them?  What if like the journals and the photographs and all the rest of this he was somehow in on it too?  Maybe that’s how they’d gotten photographs in the first place, some stash of photos he had of me as a kid.  He’d handed the photographs over to them, let them make all these fakes, then lied about it, covered it up.  It made sense, he’d been part of it all along, to give me the package, to set me up.  Now lying to me about Mallory.

I sat down on the bed, and I thought.

The sun seared in through the blinds waking me, though I didn’t remember falling asleep.  I called the front desk but there was no news.  I called Mallory’s cell phone again, but it was still going to voicemail.  It was maddening not knowing, not being able to do anything.  I drove back to the place we’d had dinner the night before, asked if anyone was working now that had been working then, hoping someone might have seen her.  No one was, no one had.  I ate breakfast, sitting near the window hoping irrationally that she’d walk by, that she’d decide to come back to a familiar place.  I sat and drank coffee looking out the window until it seemed pointless even to me.  Found myself driving around the small town aimlessly, thinking maybe I’d chance to see her, or she’d see me and feel guilty enough to return my calls.  I began to worry that maybe she hadn’t left on her own, that someone had taken her.  She’d warned me that maybe these people who’d created the journals could be dangerous, but I hadn’t listened.

I finally parked on one of the side streets, just sitting, staring, not sure what else to do.  I was beginning to feel numb, surreal.  It seemed like I should wake up at any moment, that she would be there shaking my shoulder, saying it was time to get up and check out of the hotel.  Or that I might look to my side and see her in the passenger seat, staring idly out the window with me.  But she wasn’t there, and I didn’t wake up.

The sun was shining brightly, the shop in front of where I had parked sold glassware, and the sunlight was glinting and glaring off of show pieces in the window.  My eyes seemed drawn over them of their own accord, my weariness and the strangeness of my thoughts playing together over the gleaming light.  I felt as if I was beginning to fade.

There was a knock at my window.  It startled me and I twisted my neck to see who was there, my heart leaping, then falling again when I saw it wasn’t her.  There was a middle aged woman standing outside the car.  She was wearing a black blouse and skirt, her hair was dark, hinting at silver that wasn’t quite there, her nose sharp and pronounced.  She smiled at me, and asked through the window, “Are you ok?”

It took a moment for me to recover myself, but I nodded, rolling down the window.  “Yeah, sorry.  You startled me.”

“I’m sorry.  It’s just that you’ve been sitting in front of my shop for almost thirty minutes now.  I wondered if you needed anything.”

“Oh, no.  I can move, I just meant to stop for a minute, guess I lost track of time.”

She smiled again, reached through the window and put her hand on my arm.  “You look like you could use some tea.  Why don’t you come inside?”

“I couldn’t, I’m sorry.  I won’t block your store anymore.”

She laughed a little, withdrew her hand.  “No, not at all.  No one is in that desperate a need of glassware.  Come on, I insist.  You need someone to talk to, anyone could tell that.  I was just about to make tea for myself anyway.  Please.”

Her smile was friendly, and, if not effortlessly kind, then inviting.  She looked maybe ten years older than me, but not unattractive.  I looked at the empty seat next to me.  I had nowhere else to go.

“Yeah.  Sure, thanks.”

She had poured tea for us, and though it was a glassware shop, we drank from regular coffee mugs.  It felt more natural for me, I was glad of not being entrusted with handling something expensive or delicate just then.  I half forgot to drink, just letting my head hang over the cup, breathing in the warmth and steam, feeling it in my chest, relaxing me.  After a few minutes of silence, she set her cup down to the side.

“Do you want to talk about it?”

I looked up, my focus drawing back into the room.  “I’m sorry.  Talk about what?”

“Well, I don’t know.  But you could start with whatever has you so distracted as to sit and stare at my storefront for half an hour.” She stopped and smiled.  “Only if you want to, of course.”

I took a sip of the tea, and gestured toward the little pot from which she’d poured.  “It’s very nice.”

“Thank you.”

I looked back to her, she was waiting patiently, a calm smile on her face.  “I wouldn’t know where to start.”

“Why don’t you start with today.  Everything else has a way of fitting in around it.”

I nodded, and looked down into my mug for a few moments.  I looked up at her.  “My sister’s gone.”

A look of concern showed on her face.  “Oh, I’m terribly sorry.”

“No, not like that.  She’s not dead.  She’s just gone missing.”

“For how long?”

I shrugged.  “Just since last night.  But it’s not like her.”

“Do you have any idea where she might be?”

“No.”  I paused, took a breath.  “We had a fight.  She threatened to leave, to go home.  But she didn’t tell me when she left, no one saw her leave.  And she didn’t take the car, it was still outside the hotel.  I tried the bus station, but she wasn’t there either.”

“Well, maybe she called someone back home to tell them she’d be on her way.  Have you tried calling anyone she might have thought to call?”

A laugh coughed, bitter, out of my throat.  “Yeah.”

“What did they say?”

“I called our foster dad.  He said some pretty insane stuff.”

She picked her mug back up.  “Like what?”

I didn’t answer.  It seemed crazy to tell someone I didn’t know what was going on.  But like something gave inside me I felt the words start coming out, needing to be said, to talk to someone.  “It’s… it was just strange.  He told me she was dead.  Like he was surprised I’d be asking about her.  He told me she’d been dead for months.”  I shook my head.  “But she was with me here just last night.  Has been since we started on this trip.  It was crazy.”  I caught myself with a bit of embarrassment.  “I’m sorry.  You don’t know me at all, and here I am unburdening myself to you.”

She shook her head, finished a sip from her mug.  “Don’t apologize, I asked you.  And pain makes us honest.”  She paused for a moment.  “Do you think your sister is alright?”

“I don’t know.”

I drank more tea, looking around the room.  The shop was dim, the little figures and strange glass shapes were displayed at odd angles and from unlikely positions.  Nothing seemed to have any kind of primacy of display, more like they had been simply arranged at the whim of the owner without thought to buying or selling.  Some pieces were intricate, luxurious things, while others looked simple and delicate, spires of glass and twists of glittering light.

“I guess I just don’t know what to do.  She hasn’t been gone long enough for the police to listen.  I can’t find her, she won’t return my calls, and with all the rest of what’s been happening, I just don’t know.  This whole trip was a huge mistake.”

“What was the trip for?  What were you doing?”

I stood up, setting my mug down, walked to one of the displays.  I didn’t touch things, worried I might break them, but I looked at them, wondering who bought them, how a business would be run that based on selling them.  Idle thoughts.  I didn’t know how to answer the question.  “It’s hard to explain.”

“Give it a try.”

I looked back to where she was sitting.  “Why are you being nice to me?  Why would you care about any of this?”

“You looked like you could use a friend.  I think sometimes it’s harder not to care, than it is to.  We just convince ourselves otherwise, don’t you think?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know.”

“If it’s making you uncomfortable, we can talk about something else.”

“No, it’s fine.  It’s nice to have someone to tell.  I just… think it’s strange.  Feels weird to be sharing this with you, as if we’ve been friends for years or something.”

She laughed.  “I don’t know if our little confidence is so worthy as all that.  But I hope we can be friends.”

I looked at her, thinking it was a strange thing to say.  But she was smiling, and I smiled back.  The tea had made me feel better, talking had helped.  I felt warm, like I could trust her, whether I should or not.  “The trip was… I don’t remember.  I think Mallory and I decided on it at the same time, really.”

“Mallory is your sister?”

I nodded, then shook my head with a sharp laugh.  “Oh, god.  I’m sorry, Mallory is my sister.  And my name is Chris.  I can’t believe I didn’t introduce myself.”  I extended my hand, she took it.

“It seems like you’ve had a lot on your mind.  It’s nice to meet you, Chris.  My name is Isabella.”  Her hand was pale, her fingers were long and slender, almost elegant, and they pressed lightly on my own.  She stood up, closer to me than I expected.  I could smell her perfume.  It was the smell of the store, delicate and secret, like something refined, not clamoring for attention, waiting instead for the right attention to find it out.  She held her mug out to me.  “Help me bring this back to the kitchen.”  She bent to pick up the tea pot, her skirt brushed against my leg.

She turned and walked toward the back, up a set of stairs.  I followed her up.  “The kitchen is upstairs?”

“My apartment is upstairs.  I live over the store.”

“Sounds convenient.”

“It can be, yes.”

She lead me to the kitchen, setting down the teapot.  I set the mugs on the counter beside it.  It was a small kitchen, oven and microwave mounted into the wall, no dishwasher that I could see.  There was a window to the side, it looked out over the parking lot, but beyond it you could see some of the town, and far beyond, the mountains.  There was no lamp on, just the light from the small window.  She stood, leaning back against the counter, and I leaned against the wall.

“So, your trip.”

“It’s going to sound really odd.”  She just smiled and waited.  I cleared my throat.  “About two… I guess two and a half months ago now, I got a package.  There was no return address, no indication who it was from.  When I opened it, there were all these pictures of me, as a kid.  The thing was, I didn’t remember any of them being taken.  Like any of them.  And with them were these journals, saying a bunch of strange things.”

She just looked at me quizzically.  “Who would send you something like that?”

“I didn’t know.  I still don’t.”

“How did that turn into a trip?”

“Mallory and I read through the journals.  She’s smarter than I am, she started finding all these connections.  She put together a timeline from some dates in the journals, and a rough idea of some places.  It… well, this is where it gets stranger.”

She smiled again, more broadly.  In the fading blue light of the window, the kitchen dim, I could see the white of teeth between parted lips.  “I’m listening.”

“It seemed like there was a kind of path, a journey being marked out.  If you traced the locations and dates, my ages in the photographs, you could see a kind of pattern to it.”

“What?”

“Like I said, it was strange.”

“So, what then?  You and your sister decided to just retrace the route?”

I shrugged.  “Kind of.  We couldn’t figure out where it was supposed to end.  I don’t know how to describe it without pointing you to some of the journals, but it seemed like there was a purpose to it.”  She didn’t answer.  I began to feel a new tension in the silence.  “I’m sorry.  I’ve made you uncomfortable, you think I’m delusional and you’re wondering who you’ve let into your house.”

She laughed, a bit nervously.  “I didn’t say that.  It’s just… I don’t know.  Not normal.”

“Yeah.”  I looked out through the window.  The afternoon was growing old.  “I should go.  I’ve kept you for too long already.  Thank you very much for the tea.  And for listening to me.”

She stepped toward me, touched my elbow.  I was more intimate than I expected, I almost pulled away.  “It’s Ok.  I’ve enjoyed listening.”

I cleared my throat.  “I should go back to the hotel.  See if maybe Mallory’s called, if she came back, left a message or something.”

“Ok.”

I began to walk toward the stairs, she followed me down.  We reached the front door of the shop, she touched my arm again.  “Chris, what are you doing for dinner tonight?”

“I hadn’t thought about it much, to be honest.  I’m not really very hungry.”

She smiled.  “Would you care to join me, then?  There’s a little place in town that does really good Indian food.”

I shook my head.  “I can’t, I’m sorry.  I need to try to be at the hotel, in case Mallory comes back, calls or something.  I’ve probably been here too long already.  Thank you, though.”

She nodded, then looked up at me with a smile.  “Do you have to sit your vigil alone?”

I hesitated.  “No, I guess not.”

“Then maybe I’ll call you later.  If she hasn’t come back yet, I can bring something over, sit up and wait with you.”

“Why would you do that for me?”

She smiled.  “That’s the wrong question.”

She got my cell number, and gave me hers.  I thanked her again and I drove back to the room.

Alone.  It was a strange feeling, responsible only for myself.  No one depending on me, no one to look out for, or to look out for me.  It felt quiet, a kind of empty that was more than just absence.  I’d gotten back, asked the current shift of staff all the same questions, getting back all the same answers.  I left the same instructions at the desk, and went back to the room to take a shower.  Water running over my head, I felt utterly isolated.  Mallory had been as if a whole second half of my thoughts.  I didn’t know if I had even recognized it.  What was missing was not just noise and person and space but a whole spectrum of thought, a way of thinking.  She was the one who did the considering, the planning, the fact checking.  I was the one who held on to a sense of knowing, a soundness of being.  Realizing suddenly all avenues of this were mine, that I was responsible for my own course, I felt a lightness, a repulsive thrill of freedom, and in the same instant the guilt of it.  I began to feel lost.  Thinking that perhaps there was no freedom without so being.

The sound of the water from the pipe and down into the drain, drowning out any sound from outside, even my breathing.  I leaned with my arms against the wall, my head against them, my face turned down and my eyes closed.  The water sluiced around my head, over my eyelids.  I didn’t know where I was.  If I wasn’t taking care of Mallory, I didn’t knew who I was, either.  The journals and the trip seemed far away now, a childish indulgence.  Even the mystery of it seemed pale and bloodless, a conspiracy or no, some spiritual reality or no.  It didn’t matter, I was no longer any part of it.  It couldn’t give me place, couldn’t provide any context.  What if she didn’t come back?  What if she had fled, abandoning me here, or worse, had been taken?  I was too weary to draw back up the anger and fear of it.  I felt tired and numb.  I had no bearing, no path to guide me, there was no light upon my steps, and the wood about me had grown dark.  My constant companion gone, I felt suddenly exposed and alone in a strange place, among strange people, with no thought of a better way forward.

I got out of the shower and checked my phone, but there were no new messages.  I called the front desk to check as well, the frustrated voice of an attendant, obviously busy with something else, informed me that no one had come by fitting her description, and that they would call me if anyone did.  I apologized and hung up.  Standing with the phone in my hand, I realized I could just call Mike Nelson.  I didn’t believe John.  But I didn’t understand why he would point me toward Mike, either.  And even if unlikely, I hoped maybe Mallory would have called him.  I didn’t know that many other people she could really try to turn to.  I only had his office number though, and he was gone for the evening.  I left him a message, just to have him call me back.

About half an hour later, my cellphone rang, showing Isabella’s number.

“Hi.”

“Hi.  Has your sister called?”

“No.”

“I’m sorry.”  She paused for a moment.  “If you’d rather spend the evening alone, I understand.  I’d like to help, but I don’t want to intrude.”

I sighed, ran my hand over my face.  “No, it would be nice if you came by.  I don’t think I’m going to be much good as company, though.”

“I don’t mind.”

“I’m sure you’ve got better things to do than sit in a hotel room with me.”

She laughed.  “Yes, I do.  But not things that I want to do more.”

We were silent for a moment.  I cleared my throat.  “Well, if you’d like to come by, you certainly can.  I don’t have anything much to eat here.  We could order something.”

“Why don’t I pick something up?”

“Sure, that’d be great.”

“What do you like?”

“Anything is fine, really.  I’m still not all that hungry.”

“That makes sense.  I’m going to buy food I like then, so if I get bored, I’ll at least have something to eat.”

I laughed a little.  “That sounds good.”

“See you in about an hour?”

“Ok.  I’ll see you then.”

There was a knock and Isabella’s voice.  “Chris?”

I called back.  “Hey, one second, I’ll get the door.”

She came in carrying two plastic bags, squeaking styrofoam containers in them, the smell of curry.  She smiled, walking past me and setting them down on the table.

“Hi.”

I shut the door.  “Hi.  I see you decided on Indian food after all.”

“Well, I wasn’t kidding, it’s good.”

“It smells like it.”

“I bought plenty.  I know you said you weren’t hungry, but I thought you might be once you could smell the food.  And since I didn’t know what you liked, I got a bunch of different things.”  She took off her jacket and turned around.  “Well.  How are you?  You look a little better.”

I smiled.  “I took a shower.”

“That will do it.”

I stood by the door, a little awkwardly.  She reached into one of the bags and pulled out a bottle of wine.  “A drink before dinner?  You look like you could use something to relax.”

“Yes, please.”

“You want to go get some glasses?”

“Oh, sure.”  I walked to the bathroom, picked up two of the individually wrapped plastic cups.  It would have been classier if they’d been glass, the heavy ones with the paper caps.  This wasn’t that nice of a place.  I unwrapped them and walked back.  “Sorry, looks like this is all we’ve got.”

She smiled, took them from me and set them on the table.  “It’s fine.  It’s not a particularly expensive bottle anyway.”

She poured, I took a cup and sat down, sipping it slowly.  The bite of it on my tongue, the smell of it mixing with the food, warmed me.  Another and a touch of warmth moved into my chest, down my arms.  I sighed and leaned back in my chair.  “Thank you.”

She sat down, started pulling containers of food out of the bags.  “You’re welcome.”

The thought flashed over me.  “Oh, I’m sorry.  What do I owe you for the food?”

She laughed at me.  “Do people not do nice things for one another where you live?  You don’t pay for food that’s being brought to you as a gift.”

“I didn’t want to be rude.”  I shrugged, but smiled.  “It all smells very good.”

“It should be.”

She served me different things, and I tried them.  Some with names I recognized, others were new to me, some too spicy for me to eat, though most were excellent.  We talked more about the food, about what tasted good.  I had been wrong, I was starving.  And with the wine I relaxed.  I had more than I probably should have, hard to decide on a place to stop.  I felt good, hunger had made me more anxious than I’d realized.  We both leaned back, a final glass of wine apiece, little food left to speak of on the table.  She took a sip from the cup, her lips pursed about the edge of it.  Her mouth seemed a strange contrast in sophistication to my single-use plastic cups.

“What did you fight about?”

“I’m sorry?”

“Your sister.  You said you fought, that’s why she left.  I was wondering what a fight could have been about that was so bad she’d leave.”

I laughed a little.  “Direct, aren’t you?”

She cast her eyes down, an embarrassed smile.  “I’m sorry, that was blunt of me, wasn’t it?  Blame the wine.”

“It’s fine, I like blunt.”  Edges of sorrow crept back in.  I felt warm and comfortable and calm, but as if by some impersonal momentum, and it felt as if it was slowing, likely to leave me behind.  “It might not make sense.”

“That’s ok.  It doesn’t have to.”

I nodded, took my time.  I set my glass down on the table.  “I told you a little about the journals.”

“The ones that came with the photographs.”

“Yeah.”  I hesitated.  “I don’t know what to say that won’t sound crazy.  Really, that’s why she left.”

“I don’t understand.”

“The journals talk about things… like supernatural things.  I don’t know much about that stuff.  But we’ve had these strange experiences.  Things that made me start to think the journals were at least partially telling the truth.”

“Like what?”

“It’ll sound strange out of context.  Like, we were in a cemetery.  We’d found a place where one of the photographs had been taken.  Like all the others, I couldn’t remember it either.  I tried to stand in the same position I’d been in as a kid in the photograph, hoping it might help me remember.  I knelt down on the ground and Mallory starts… I don’t have a better way to say this.  Prophesying.  About me, I think.”

“That’s…  I don’t know what to say to that.”

I nodded, took another drink from my cup.  “I know.  That’s what I mean.  And then this guy, this mechanic in New Orleans that I’ve never met before.  He has a key to a cabin just north of here in the mountains.  He gives it to me in a letter that warns about ghosts.  We drive here, to the cabin.  Inside it has more pictures like the ones that were sent to me.  Previous drafts of the journals, strange kinds of research.”

She didn’t answer.  Her face was drawn, uncomfortable.  I tried to laugh a little to relieve the tension, but it wasn’t convincing.  “So I don’t know.  I guess I started to wonder what was going on.  That maybe there was really something to it.”

“It sounds dangerous.  Like someone’s manipulating you.”

“That’s the thing, yeah.”

“What do you mean?”

“That’s what Mallory and I were arguing about before she left.  I called the hospital where she’d stayed back home most recently, because we found a photograph of one of the nurses that had worked with her.  A photograph of someone I don’t think I’ve ever met, but related to me by proxy, there in the cabin.  When I got in touch with the nurse, she acted like she had no idea what was going on.  And then suddenly, quietly, she told me that this was a hoax, some kind of game being played.  And then she wouldn’t say anything else about it and hung up.”

“She wanted you to leave all this alone, didn’t she?  Your sister, I mean.  She wanted you to let it go and stop trying to figure anymore of it out.”

I nodded.  “Yeah.”

“She was right.”

I ran my hands over my face, back through my hair.  “I know.”

“Then why were you arguing with her about it?”

“I…”  I stopped.  I stood up and pushed open the blinds, looking out at the parking lot.  “That’s hard to explain, too.”

“Harder than the rest of it?”

I didn’t answer immediately.  Eventually I let the blinds fall back, turned to face her.  “It’s a feeling.  I can’t explain it right.  But I think there’s something out there.  Something waiting for me.”  I was quiet for a moment, trying to put my thoughts together.  “My life’s been really empty.  Outside of working trivial jobs and taking care of Mallory, I don’t have much of anything.  With all of this… even crazy, it’s like somehow it makes my life matter.  Mean something.”

She stood up.  I thought for a moment she was going to leave.  She walked to me and she put her arms under my arms, and she hugged me, putting her face against my chest.  I put my arms around her almost tentatively, unsure of what she was doing.  She spoke, her words soft into my shoulder.

“I’m sorry.”

I rested my cheek against her hair.  It was too intimate, more than I was comfortable with.  But the wine and the warmth and the fear and the loneliness and the sudden intimacy felt as right as anything else.  “It’s not your fault.  You don’t have to be sorry.”

Her voice was low, husky, almost with tears.  “I do.”  She turned her face to me, put her hand along my cheek.  “Beautiful boy.”

My face tightened with question.  “What?”

She shook her head.  “Nothing.”  She leaned in and kissed me.  Before my thoughts were aware of it, I was kissing back.

She pulled my arms around her and slid hers around my neck.  Her lips opened and she was kissing me harder, her tongue in my mouth, my tongue in hers.  She pressed her body against mine, she was warm, soft but firm against me.  She took the back of my head gently and pulled me tighter to her, I slid my hands into her hair.  She stepped back and sat down on the bed, pulling me down beside her.  She kissed me harder, her teeth on my lip, her hands running down my body, untucking my shirt.  I slid my hand behind her, beneath her skirt, squeezing her ass and thigh.  A small moan escaped her lips, more hungry than abandoned.  She pulled my shirt from me and pushed me down, her hands on my shoulders.  I slid my hands up under her shirt, cupping her breasts, sliding up under the bra, my fingers brushing across her nipples.  She gasped a little breath and pushed my hands away, took off her shirt, then her bra.  She smiled and leaned down, kissing my chest.  She kissed my stomach, her hands on my belt, undoing my pants.  She pulled them from me.  She slipped her skirt off as well, and slid her knee along my leg, climbing on top of me.

And then nothing.  She was leaning down, her tongue in my ear, and my body wouldn’t respond.  My brain was on fire with the sex and scent of her, and my body… wouldn’t.  We kissed and she slid her hand down and put it on me, rubbing gently, but still, nothing.  Eventually she shifted off of me, sitting beside me.

“It’s Ok.”

I felt humiliated.  “No… god, I’m sorry.  It’s… I don’t know what’s wrong.  I want to.”

She smiled, ran her hand over my shoulder comfortingly.  “You’re in a bad place right now.  I should have known better than to try to push sex on the situation.”

I shook my head.  “No, I wanted to.  I still do… shit, I’m really sorry.”  My face was burning, but she laughed and leaned over and kissed me.  I sat there naked and ashamed, and began to feel cold, her skin strange against me.

“I’m alright with trying again later, if you are.  It’s no big deal.”

My phone rang.  For a moment I didn’t know what it was, a sound alien to the space.  And then as if a different world, somewhere I had but moments ago left behind, rushed back in.

“Shit, I’m sorry.  That might be Mallory.”

She smiled and sat up, her pale skin naked, her hair twisted.  “Of course.  Go ahead.”

I reached for my phone and looked at the caller id.  It was Mike Nelson.  I looked back at Isabella.  “I’m sorry, it’s Mallory’s doctor.  I need to take this.”

She nodded, sat down and reached for her clothes.  I started pulling on my pants.

I answered.  “Mike?”

“Chris, hi.  I was checking my voicemail from home, got your message.  Do you have a minute to talk?”

“Um, yeah.  Hold on one second, Ok?”

“Sure.”

I muted the phone, picked up my shirt.  “I’m really sorry.  I just need to ask him a few things.”

She grinned, putting her bra back on.  “No, it’s ok.  I’ll wait.”

“Thank you.”  I pulled my shirt over my head.  “I’m going to take it outside if you don’t mind.”

She shook her head.  “Go, take the call.”

I opened the door and stepped outside.

“Hey, sorry about that.”

“Not a problem.”

“Thanks for calling me back.”

“Sure, Chris.”  He paused.  “Actually, I spoke with John earlier, he called me this morning.”

“What did he say?”

“Not a lot, actually.  He seemed pretty upset, asked me to try to get in touch with you, if you’d be willing.  Said you two had a bit of a falling out.”

“You could say that.”

“So, what’s going on, then?  Everything Ok?”

I paused, took a breath.  “No, I don’t think it is.”

“What’s wrong?”

“I’m on a trip right now.  Been driving across the country.”

“Sounds nice.”

“Yeah.  Mallory and I… I just thought we needed to spend some time together, things had been strange recently.”

“I’m sorry?”

“The problem is that Mallory is missing.  I don’t know where she went.  She was with me on this trip, and then she wasn’t.  I called John to see if she’d talked to him, and he gave me some story.”

“What story was that?”

“He said Mallory was dead.  He said that she’d been gone for months.  He even said that you were there at her funeral.”

Mike didn’t respond.  I waited, but he said nothing.  Finally I asked.  “Talk to me, Mike.”

“I… I don’t know how to say this.  This is not the right forum at all.”  He took a deep breath, let it out slowly.  “Chris, John’s telling you the truth.”

“What do you mean?  He said she was dead.”

“She is.  She committed suicide.  You were the one to find her.”  He paused, strain in his voice.  “I was there with you and John when you buried her.”

“That’s not possible.”

“I’m sorry, Chris.  I’m sorry, too, because this isn’t the right situation to talk to you about this.  You should come back here, maybe we can figure this out together.”

“I don’t understand what you’re telling me.  She can’t be dead.  She’s been with me this whole time.”

“There are terms for your kind of symptoms, but you’re not in your right mind.  I can’t know what you’ve experienced, and I’m sure it’s seemed very real, but… she’s gone, Chris.  She has been for two months.”

“No.”

“I’m sorry.”

“I don’t believe you.”

“It’s Ok.  Come home.  We can talk about it.”

I had tears on my face, I hadn’t noticed them begin to fall.  “Home.  What home?  If she’s not there then what the fuck are you talking about?  Where the fuck is Mallory, Mike?  Why are you and John doing this?”  I was crying now.  Yelling.  “Where is she?  Goddamn you, you tell me where she is!”  I didn’t know where it came from.  It took me over before I could help it.  I fell down to my knees and closed my phone, dropping it to the ground, crying.  It began to buzz against the asphalt of the parking lot.  The door to the hotel room opened and Isabella stepped out.

“Oh my god!”  She ran to my side, kneeling down next to me.  She touched my face, held my head against her.  There against her shoulder I couldn’t stop crying.

Mallory was dead.  I remembered now.
