Epistle Six, because there are two.

You have departed from the path, though perhaps this is as it must be.  What you seek lies farther on, but there are nearer goals before, and as you have tarried, she has smiled on you, but she will wait not forever.

There is a branch in a high place, as the gods have sown their careless seed.  Gather it and come, we have already waited long.  She groans in the earth, and we tremble, and you dream.

You are ever twin or lover, twined about and through.  Upon her face do you see other than your own most secret self displayed?  Does she speak or do you, softly, with a voice you cannot quite intend?  For however you might love, there is a jealous other, and your greater longing she will certain claim.  Until you, like I, cannot but turn forever after, that she might love us now, again.

-----

Dreams continued to come.  But long weeks passed, and as the weather turned colder, the air beginning to smell like snow, I ceased to worry over them.  I managed to keep the job at the hospital; Mike had an orderly position on his staff that he said would open soon.  He started talking to me about getting some EMT training, maybe one day even going to school for a nursing degree, building a real career.  It felt strange to come home at the end of a day content, feeling like maybe I was working toward something.

I went to see Mallory’s grave every couple of days, finding that it became easier, the more I did it, to talk to someone that wasn’t there.  Talking seemed to help.  I would go and laugh with her, alone in the grass, listening to the leaves.  I’d go and yell at her, angry that she was gone.  Angry sometimes that I’d lived so much of my life for her, just to have her end her own silently and with no special warning.  But there was more laughing and talking than there was yelling or crying, and soon enough there weren’t anymore tears at all, only words and laughter left.  The silence of the earth and a headstone made a better confidant than I would have imagined, and though the sky was turning gray and winter was coming on, small things began to grow inside of me, that I had not thought alive at all.

Stephanie and I started seeing one another.  It was strange; I’d been sure I couldn’t trust her.  In the beginning I had only hoped to discover something more about the voice she’d heard threatening on the phone, what greater scope she might let slip of a broader, secret role.  But nothing much emerged.  I asked her out a few weeks after we walked in the park that afternoon.  She resisted at first, afraid someone might be watching us, that they might start calling her again.  No one did.  And the more time we spent together, the more I liked spending it.  The more she seemed to like spending it with me.  We’d have dinner and drinks, watch movies at one another’s apartments.  More quickly than I would have expected she ended up with an overnight bag in my bedroom, I with one like it in hers.  I wouldn’t have predicted any of it it; it didn’t start like much of a romance.  Suspicion, and at best two people with a shared source of trauma.  But when those faded we were left with something more than had been there when it started.

We didn’t talk about the voice on the phone, my trip with Mallory, or the journals much after the first few weeks.  We both skirted around it, turning a willfully blind eye.  I didn’t push for details she wasn’t comfortable giving once I realized she had nothing more of substance to share.  She didn’t dig to find why I’d ever wanted to know in the first place.  And if I didn’t forget the trip, it receded into the background.  The goddess and the journals and the cabin and all of it began to seem like a strangely muddled vision, one I’d finally roused from and hoped soon to abandon.

Except for my dreams.  They began to grow more elaborate and strange.

Stephanie and I were on the couch one evening, she was lying back in my arms.  We had the television on, watching something we’d rented.  A man with a gun and some other guys who’d robbed something, maybe kidnapped someone.  I wasn’t really paying attention, beginning to drift off a little.  I was tired and she was, but it was pleasant.  No interruptions, no sound but the occasional swell of soundtrack or shouted dialogue between the over-loud crack of gunfire.  Her head was leaned back against me heavily, and my eyes were beginning to slide closed.  She felt me leaning my head back and roused a little.

She mumbled softly.  “Hey, you falling asleep?”

My voice sleepy, quiet.  “Just a little.  You?”

“Yeah.  A little.”  She turned and laid her cheek against my chest, curling into me.  I put my arms around her, my eyes still closed.  Neither of us spoke for a few minutes, just lying there quietly, comfortably.  Finally she lifted her head a bit, I opened my eyes.

“You Ok?”

“Yeah.  Just thinking about something at work today.”

“Anything important?”

She laid her face back down against my chest.  “I don’t know.”

“Is something wrong?”

“I hope not.”  She sat up a little and I did as well.

“You want to talk about it?”  She looked over at the TV.  I picked up the remote and stopped the movie.

She looked back.  “I don’t know whether to tell you.  Things have been… nice, between us.  Really good, I think.”

“I agree.”

“I don’t want things to go back to the way they were before.”

“What do you mean?”

She shook her head.  “I don’t know.”

“What’s wrong, Steph?”

She leaned in and kissed me, then pulled back and started talking quietly.  “There was a guy who came in today, asking about your sister.  Turns out he was a detective.  Doctor Nelson pulled me into his office after he left, told me not to tell you.  He said it might upset you, that it would be best if you didn’t find out until he knew a little more.”  She stopped talking, looking at me.  “I don’t want to upset you or anything.  I just didn’t want to lie to you, either.”

I didn’t know what to say for a minute.  I looked at her with a tight smile, but reached over and squeezed her hand.  “It does worry me a little.  But thanks for telling me.”

“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you immediately.  Just that Mike said…”

“No, it’s Ok.  I get it.  It’s nice of him to be concerned.  Nice of you to try to protect me, too.”  She was quiet.  After a minute I spoke again.  “Did you see the cop?”

“Only as he was walking out.  Just a guy in a gray suit.”

“Did Mike say what he asked about specifically?”

“No.  He just knew someone might mention it to me, and he wanted to try to keep it quiet, until he had time to talk to police more.  Before he talked to you about it, he wanted to have a few more answers.”

“Answers about what?”

“I don’t know.”

We sat there quietly, I looked down at her.  “I won’t let things get like they did before.”

She nodded, but didn’t answer.

“I care about my sister, you know I do.  But you’re right, this is good.  What we have here.”

“I think so, too.”

She leaned up and kissed me.  I kissed her back.  “I would like to talk to Mike about it, though.  I can tell him someone else told me, if you’d rather.”

She shook her head.  “You can tell him I told you.  I said I might.”

I smiled at her, kissed her again.  “You’re pretty alright, you know that?”

She smiled back.  “I am sometimes.”

I waited until my shift was over the next day.  I’d changed clothes to go home, tried to drop by Mike’s office but he wasn’t in.  I asked some of the nurses if they knew where he was, but they didn’t.  Thought about waiting for him, but decided against it.  I wanted to know what was going on, but it would wait.  I took a piece of paper from his desk and left him a note saying I’d like to try to chat with him when he had time.

It was still early enough in the afternoon, I went to visit Mallory.  The wind was blowing, and the temperature for the evening was supposed to dip well below freezing.  The trees had all finally shed their leaves, the wind waving bare branches back and forth above me.  I remembered my jacket but had forgotten gloves, had to keep my hands jammed down in my pockets.  I walked toward her headstone, my breath in the air, and started talking before I actually reached her grave, my eyes turned up to the sky.

“I’m gonna have to start making these trips a little shorter, Mal.  I suppose you don’t particularly notice that it’s cold out here, but I’m freezing.”

I walked to her plot and I stopped a little short.  There was a flower on the headstone, and an envelope beneath.  John had left flowers here once or twice, I’d seen them when I’d come to visit, but so far nothing else had been left.  There was a rock placed over both the flower and the envelope, holding them in place against the wind.  I assumed it must be from John as well, thinking maybe he’d left Mallory a letter.  I could see that being a good way to grieve.  I picked the stone up just to see if I could make out the handwriting, figured whatever was inside wasn’t really my business.  Except as I looked at it, I saw it had my name on it.  I turned it over but there was nothing else written.  I opened it and pulled out a few pages.

Chris,

I’ve watched as you’ve come to visit me.  I’ve listened as you’ve talked, cried as you’ve cried, laughed as you’ve laughed.  I have been here every moment with you, though you could not see me.  And might not, had you been so able, wanted to.  I know you’ve tried to leave some of it behind.  I’m glad you have.

I’m also glad that there’s someone in your life.  Someone that doesn’t need you, but that wants you instead.  It’s good to see you grow.  You’ve sounded happier than I’ve known you to be in a long time.  I want that for you.

I want also to say I’m sorry.  For so many things, though perhaps most for having left you, twice, without saying goodbye.  Abandonment was never something either of us bore well, and I put you through it not once, but twice in quick succession.  I’m so very sorry for it.  The first time I felt there was no other way, and the second time I knew it.  If that does not make sense now, perhaps one day it will.

You’ve all but abandoned the journey, the photographs, the journals, and the goddess.  That is probably for the best.  To move on.

That is what I wish I could say.  But it is not what I have seen, now.

I was there with you in the mirror.  I was there when she came to you, and took your hand.  I saw her in the sky with you and I saw her transfixed above the earth, in swirling lines of brilliant golden fire.  I came when I was called, only to speak with you, but what I was in that place was taken from me, and all I had been was in that moment utterly transformed.  I am her priestess, now, though no more alive.

How it could have been that I was with you on the road.  It sprang not from a broken mind as you have these passing months so feared, but from what I became, and back through our strange history, still become.  If the past and present of it seem not to fit, that is as it should be.  She has changed what even such as these can mean.

And so I say now to you as I did not, for lack of understanding, say before.  The task is not yet complete, my wounded brother.  And though this life you begin here to build is one worth struggling to protect and save, there is a remnant of the one before it that will not so easily be abandoned or ignored.  You must complete what we began, and find your way down the final steps of that strange and winding path.  She waits for you, and she does, and there are two but I cannot tell you which or why.  That one loves you and the other loves the other is all that I can say.

There is a flower at my graveside.  Now there is another.

She waits to be born, and she is calling to you.  You have dreamt it, and you have seen it in the mirror.  Find her where she rests and waits.  And then do as you must.  The age before us comes, whether we will or no.

Your loving sister.  Always.

- Mallory

I re-read it, and then again, having hoped that this was behind me.  If they had sent me a box of photographs now, or some strange prophecy, I could have easily ignored it.  And that Isabella was in league with them, and passed along the substance of what I had shared with her about what I had seen in the mirror, didn’t surprise me in the least.  More I was surprised that they would continue this after these months of silence.  A cop asking about Mallory, and now this, seemed an unlikely coincidence.  I folded the pages and put them in my pocket, bent down to the ground and squeezed my hand into the brown grass.

“Mal, I have to go take care of this.  I’ll come back when I can.”

Stephanie wasn’t supposed to get out of work for another few hours, and I didn’t know what I’d have told her yet anyway.  She hadn’t known anything about my vision with Isabella.  I had been there and it scarcely made sense to me, I had no idea how I would try to make it make sense to her.  I picked up the phone and dialed, grudgingly calling the only person I could think might know something.

“Hello?”

“Isabella?  This is Chris.”

There was a silence on the other end of the phone.  Finally she spoke.  “I didn’t think I’d hear from you again.”

“You wouldn’t have.  But something happened today and I need to ask you about it.”

“Anything.”

“The vision I had that night, when you drugged me or whatever that was.  What did you tell them about it?”

“Tell who?”

“Don’t play with me.  You know exactly who I mean.”

She didn’t answer immediately.  When she did, her voice was quiet.  “I just told them that I’d had you over here one last time.  I didn’t tell them what we saw together.  I swear.”

I paused for a moment.  “I know you’re lying.  Just level with me, I already have proof.”

“I don’t know what you mean.”

“I got a letter today.”

“From whom?”

“My dead sister.”

“I’m sorry, what?”

“I went to visit her grave.  I’ve been doing that, it helps me think.  There was a letter on the headstone, and, coincidently enough, a purple-white flower, just like the glass one you gave me.”

“Wait, are you serious?”

“Just tell me what you told them.”  I paused, I took a deep breath and sighed, starting over more slowly.  “They’d been leaving me alone, y’know?  I hadn’t gotten any strange knocks at the door, no new boxes of photographs, no scraps of prophecy left for me to find.  I thought it was over.  I’m trying to rebuild a life, here.  But this letter… it gets in the way.  It stirs things back up that I’d rather left in peace.  And only you could have told them some of this.”

“What did it say?  I don’t even know what it is I’m supposed to have told them.”

“The vision, Isabella.  Whatever the hell happened that night.  The letter has details.  Things only you would know, because I talked about them that night after it happened.”

“I didn’t say anything.  To anyone.  They didn’t know.”

I ran my hand over my face in frustration, taking the phone away from my ear for a second.  I took a moment and put it back.  “Well, someone did.  And they wrote it into a letter and left it on my sister’s grave, and signed it with her name.  It was either you, or it was them.  I think it was you, working with them.  But it doesn’t really matter.  Either way, I don’t like being fucked with like this.  Maybe a few months ago I was in a different place, had more patience for it, or was so lost as to just not know any better.  But I know better, now, Isabella.  I don’t need this in my life.”

“I understand.  But I didn’t tell them.  And I didn’t write any letter.”

“Right.”  I paused for a minute.  “I guess that’s it then.”

I hung up the phone.  I thought she might call back, but she didn’t.

I showed the letter to Stephanie that night.  I had mentioned Isabella in passing before, just enough to fill in the spaces of the story.  Not lying, but skipping over the awkward parts.  The sex we almost had, the ritual and the vision.  I’d been crazier then.  A whole other person from the way I was feeling now.  I hadn’t wanted to bring up what could just be buried and forgotten.  But it wouldn’t stay gone.  I ended up telling her the whole of it, even the weird few minutes of foreplay.  About the fact the Isabella had also been set on me by a voice on the phone, or so she said.  To her credit Stephanie took it calmly, and listened to me.  She didn’t get angry, though I could see reason why she would have.

When I was done she shrugged and smiled, taking my hand.  “It’s alright.  It makes sense that you’d have tried to just let it go.”

“I know.  I just… I didn’t want you to think I was keeping something from you on purpose.  Just didn’t seem like it would help anything to bring all of it up before.”

She shook her head.  “It’s Ok.  I didn’t detail my sex life and assorted weird shit for you either.”

I smiled.  “Are there things I need to know?”

“Hey!” She mock-hit me, smiling, but quickly her face turned more serious.  “Only, I don’t think I understand the… the thing with the mirror.  Whatever that was.”

“I don’t either.”

She nodded, but looked at me.  “But, what happened?  She drugged you, and you were… what?  Tripping, hallucinating?”

“I think so.”

“You only think so?”

“It… it was just strange, is all.  I don’t know how else to describe it.”

“And she was the only one you told about what you saw?”

“Yeah, I was still really groggy.  I didn’t know what had happened, what she drugged me with.  I was pretty upset.”

She nodded.  “That makes sense.  But why would they want to know about it?  How would it help them?”

“I don’t know.  I mean, why are they doing any of this?”

She shook her head.  “I really don’t know.”

I didn’t wait until my shift ended the next day.  When I saw Mike was free, I pulled him aside.

“Can we talk for a few minutes?”

He looked down the hall.  “Right now isn’t good for me, Chris.  I’ve got a meeting.”

“Ok.  When would be good?”

“This afternoon?”

“Alright.”  I glanced at my watch.  “Around one?”

“Sure.”

I waited and I worked until one, taking my lunch break in time to meet him.  I showed up at his office door a few minutes early, he was at his desk filling out some paperwork.  He looked up.  “Hey, Chris.  You want to go somewhere?”

“Yeah, that’s fine.”

He stood up, flipped closed a folder and put it back down in a filing cabinet.  He picked up his jacket and keys and walked out, turned and locked his door.  We walked down the hall to the parking lot.

“I guess this is about the detective that was here the other day?  I assume Stephanie told you.”

I nodded.  “Partially, yeah.  There’s some other stuff.”

“Ok.”

We didn’t say anything else until we were in the car.  He drove an old Jeep, he turned the heat on, revved the engine to warm it up.  He pulled out of the parking space and started driving.

“Have a preference for where we go?”

“No.”

He pulled out into traffic, turning toward the strip of restaurants down from the hospital.

“So, what did Stephanie tell you?”

“Nothing really.  Just that you’d told her there was a cop around, asking about Mallory.  That you’d asked her not to worry me with it for now.”

“I did.  I wasn’t trying to hide it from you, I just don’t know exactly what they want yet.”

I shook my head.  “It’s Ok, I understand why you’d try to insulate me some.  We’re talking about it now, that’s enough.”

He nodded.  “Good.”  We drove for a few minutes, he merged over to the left-hand lane.  “What did you want to know?”

“What he was asking about, I guess.  Stephanie said that you didn’t want to tell me anything until you had a few more answers.  Answers to what?”

He let out a slow sigh.  “They’re investigating Mallory’s death.”

“What?  Why?”

“I don’t really know why, yet.  He just said he needed to see some of her records, what medications she was on, that kind of thing.”

“Can they do that?”

He shrugged.  “Not a lot of privacy for the dead.”

I didn’t say anything for a few minutes.  Mike turned across traffic and into the parking lot of a restaurant and parked.  We didn’t get out immediately.  “I don’t understand.  It was ruled a suicide by the medical examiner almost immediately.  And… well, you know, she’d tried before.  Suicide for a mental patient can’t be that uncommon, at least not enough to merit a new investigation.”

He turned the car off and opened his door, I got out with him, walking around the side of the car.  He put his keys in his pocket and we started walking toward the doors.  “You’re right, it’s not that uncommon.  I don’t know why he’s looking into it, he couldn’t tell me.”

“Well why would he need to know about her medications?  What else do they think it was?”

“He didn’t say.”

“What do you think?”

“I don’t know.  Malpractice, wrongful death maybe, if they think we were in error in our choices about medication.  Really, the only other option is… well, homicide.”

“That’s… she hung herself.  I found her body.”

Mike pulled open a door and I stepped inside, he followed me in.  “I know.”

I was quiet for a few minutes.  The hostess came up and led us back to a table.  I took my jacket off and sat down, Mike did the same.

“Do they think I had something to do with it?”

“I don’t know.”

“I’d make a reasonable suspect though, right?  I had a key, I found the body.”

“Yeah.  If there was motive, you would.”

“But what motive?  I mean, angst?  I loved her.  And it’s not like she left me money or something.”

He smiled.  “I don’t know.”  He picked up his menu and laughed a little.  “Look, I wouldn’t worry too much about it.  We both know you didn’t have anything to do with it.  I’d imagine this will blow over.”

“Yeah.”

The waitress came, took a drink order.  Mike set his menu down and looked back over at me.

“You said there was some other stuff, too?”

I shrugged and looked around.  I picked up the salt shaker and shook it back and forth for a minute, then looked back toward him.  My voice came out more hushed than I meant for it to.  “I found a letter the other day.”

“Ok.”

“On Mallory’s headstone.  Addressed to me, written as if it was from her.”

“Are you serious?”

“Yeah.”  I took the letter out of my pocket and handed it to him.  He read it in silence, then handed it back to me.

“I don’t understand.”

I shook my head.  “It’s…  I met a woman while I was on the trip.  We… did some drugs together.”

“Chris…”

“I know.  I was just in a bad place.  Honestly, I didn’t even know she’d slipped me anything until I finished the glass of wine.”

“She drugged you?”

“Yeah.  But I’m fine.  It’s just that the stuff in the letter, about a vision.  While I was… well, under or whatever, I hallucinated some.  That’s what I saw.  I told this woman about it, once I came down enough to talk about it.  I was fairly distraught.”

“And you think she… what?  Wrote this letter to you, signed Mallory’s name?”

“I don’t know what I think, Mike.  I think that’s a possibility.  When I found the letter I called her and confronted her about it, but she didn’t admit to anything.”  I paused for a minute.  “I also think it’s possible that I wrote the letter, and don’t remember.  If I could have a full set of false memories about my sister while traveling, I don’t know.  Maybe I set myself up.”

“Maybe.  It’s possible.”

“I don’t know what I’m really looking for here.  It’s just that with the cop asking about Mallory’s death all of a sudden, and then finding this letter… I’m worried.  I just don’t know specifically what I should be worried about, but I can’t seem to help it.  I feel like the cop and the letter happening at the same time is more than coincidence.  But I don’t want to be delusional or paranoid, and thought maybe you could act as an objective set of eyes on this, tell me other things it could be.  Something obvious I’m not seeing.”

He looked across the table at me, and picked the letter back up and scanned over it, then set it down.  “I’m not sure what to make of it, to be honest with you.”

I nodded, folded the letter back up and put it back in my pocket.  The waitress came and took our food order, putting drinks down on the table.  Mike unwrapped his straw and put it in his glass, then looked back over at me.

“Why don’t you let me worry about the cop, for now?”

“What do you mean?”

“Just let me find out what they’re doing.  What’s going on with this.  Don’t stress out about it until we know more.”

“Ok.”

“Have you told Stephanie about the letter?”

“I did.”

“What did she say?”

“She didn’t know what to make of it either.”

He nodded.  “You should probably avoid telling anyone else about it.  It sounds… delusional.”

“I know.”

He looked out the window beside our table.  I could feel the cold coming in through the glass.  Mike spoke again.  “If it helps, I don’t think you wrote it.  I don’t think you’re crazy.  And… I’ve been keeping an eye on you.  Just in case.”

I nodded.  “Thanks.  You should probably keep doing it.”

He nodded back, eyes still out the window, seeming absorbed in thought.

“Are you coming over tonight?”  Stephanie was on the other end of the phone.  She had gotten off earlier than me, I called her while driving home.

“If you’ll have me.”

She laughed.  “I will, in fact, have you.  Maybe more than once.”

I laughed back.  I was quiet for a minute. “I talked to Mike today.  About the cop, and the letter.”

“How’d it go?”

“Alright, I guess.  He didn’t have any real answers.”

“Did he say what the cop was looking for?”

“Yeah.  Some.”

“Well?”

“They’re investigating Mallory’s death.”

“Why would they do that?”

“I don’t know.  Mike didn’t either.”

“I don’t understand.  I thought it was… pretty cut and dry.”

“I thought so, too.”

“What do they think the hospital will be able to tell them?”

“I’m really not sure.  He said they were going to look over her records.  Maybe for malpractice or wrongful death or something.”

“If this was closed, wouldn’t someone have had to push them to re-open it?  I don’t think cops have time to just start poking around into closed cases.”

“I know.”

“Who would do that?”

“No one.  No one I can think of, anyway.”

We were both quiet for a minute.  She said, “I’m sure it’ll turn out to be nothing.”

“Yeah.”  I paused.  “I’m almost home.  You mind if I let you go?  I’m gonna shower and change.  I’ll be over later.”

“That’s fine.  I’ll see you soon.”

I hung up, and drove home.

Stephanie and I spent the evening together.  My mood was distant, but she understood.  I did my best to shake off the day and just enjoy the evening.  We made dinner together, opened a bottle of wine, and ate.  Watched a little TV, but mostly talked.  Really, she talked and I listened, but like she knew that’s what I needed, she kept going.  She thought going back to school was a good idea for me, she’d printed out some local community college information, some online courses I could take to get started when I wanted to, just refresher courses and prerequisite stuff.  It helped take my mind off of the letter, the cop, and the background noise that had left me alone for these last few months, but was now back in my head.  The questions about the pictures and the journals, the frustration at having my life trifled with from the outside.  I was angry, at a low but simmering level, that this was finding its way back into my life again.

We went to bed earlier than usual, and I had a hard time falling asleep.  I tossed and turned, thoughts refusing to be silent.  There wasn’t a good angle I could find to approach any of this.  I couldn’t make a detective leave things alone, even though there was nothing for him to find.  And the letter had gotten under my skin.  I got up quietly, put my clothes on and went for a walk outside.  I didn’t know her apartment complex very well, but there wasn’t enough of it to get lost in.  I walked down to the pond that had been carved out in the center of the complex.  There was a fountain going, looked like it was supposed to have four lights surrounding it, but one was burnt out.  It failed to be pretty in the same way most do, not from any specific fault but that it was a manufactured thing, sounding more like someone was splattering water on a sidewalk with a hose than the gentle rush of a waterfall.  I walked around the edge, looking at the parking lot street lamps reflected in the small ripples.  It was cold, the breeze came off the pond more sharply than I would have expected.

I tried to think about what the detective might hope to find, who would have been pressing for this to happen.  But my mind wouldn’t stay on it.  In the cold and the sharp breeze my thoughts felt like they were being snatched away from me, taken where they would without my consent.  I thought about the vision I’d had with Isabella, why they would choose that to use in the letter.  I thought back over the trip, finding memories came easier than I would have perhaps liked.  Trying to leave it behind seemed to work only when I actively thought of something else.

I walked around the pond and went back to the apartment, opening the door slowly and quietly, hoping not to wake Stephanie.  I saw the light on in the bedroom, and called in to her.

“Hey, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you up.  I couldn’t sleep, I decided to go for a walk.”  There was no answer.  I took off my jacket and hung it up, kicked off my shoes.  “You Ok?”

I walked to the bedroom, she was sitting on the bed holding the phone in her lap.  Her face was pale, and she looked shaken.  I sat down on the bed next to her and put my hand on hers.

“Hey, what’s wrong?  Are you alright?”

She shook her head, and looked at me.

“They just called me again.”

They’d told her to tell me that it wasn’t over, that I had more to do.  They’d apparently known we were together.  They even knew I would be outside when they called.  Stephanie stayed pale for a long time, her lips tight.  She was scared.  Like the last few months were suddenly bypassed and she was back where she was before, being threatened by a voice on the phone.  And though it was someone else’s voice I couldn’t help but feel like I was the one causing the grief.  If I just did what they wanted, this could go away again, at least for her.  She didn’t need to be part of it.

I held her for a while.  Eventually, frightened or not, she was tired and fell asleep against me.  I let her sleep, the light on in the room, the phone still in her hand.  I sat for hours with her head against my chest, my arms around her.  She was afraid and I was the cause of it and I didn’t know what to do.  I thought about it, trying to think of anything that I could act on, something I could actually do to make this better.  If I were to do what they wanted, to start back on the trip, to get back on the road…  Where would I go, and what would be the point?  I didn’t know where they wanted me to be.  The journey had become sidetracked and stalled, and I’d gone home.  It was over.

Eventually she woke up to go use the bathroom, she came back out and laid down next to me.  I stroked her hair, and it didn’t take long for her to fall back asleep.  I pulled the blankets over her, but didn’t bother trying to sleep myself.  There was no way I’d be able to.  I stood up and took the phone, walking into the living room, pulling the door partially closed behind me.  I tried to call the number back, but it just rang, and caller ID was blocked.  I went back into the bedroom and pulled one of my small notebooks from my bag, and walked again quietly to the living room with it in hand.  I started writing angry, undirected sentences, only loosely connected one to the next.  Whatever came into my head, trying to solve a problem that wouldn’t cohere, that wouldn’t reduce itself to something I could even clearly base a decision on.  Was it worth it to let someone call us, harass her in the middle of the night, for me to avoid some part of my life I didn’t even remember?  It seemed like it was my problem, something I should handle.  I just didn’t know where to begin.  Whatever journey Mallory and I had mapped out, this was a different one I was on, now.

We went to work the next day, Stephanie had a double shift so we didn’t see one another the next night.  I think she was glad of the work, to not be at home worrying there would be a call that she would be afraid to answer.  I spent the evening at my apartment, pulling out the journals and the photographs, pouring over what I’d looked at so many times before.  The other photographs from the cabin, too, I tried to look at, to understand them in some context, but they didn’t make that much sense.  Most were just pictures of people I didn’t know.

I stopped really looking, stopped really reading.  Just staring at the map.  I looked at where Mallory’s red line ended between two towns.  They’d been just a best guess, not even marking with certainty where we should stop driving if we got that far.  We’d just put that part off, figuring it would make sense when we got there, or it wouldn’t and we’d go home.  At the time it hadn’t really mattered.  There were places marked on the map that we hadn’t gone, places after New Orleans that we never made it to, having gone up to Arkansas and off the plotted journey altogether.  I looked at it and I made a decision.

I would skip to the end.  I wasn’t interested in the game anymore.  I wasn’t interested in seeing the places I’d been as a kidnapped child, unraveling some mystery that meant nothing to me.  I just wanted this to be over, and I wanted them to stop calling Stephanie and I wanted them to not leave upsetting correspondence in unexpected places.  It wasn’t an adventure anymore.  There was no romance in it.  I just wanted it to end, and to be left alone.  I decided I’d do what they asked.  I’d get back on the road and I’d finish this.  But I was only driving to the end, no more photographs and trying to remember.  No more goddess that I thought might be real.  I was just going to the end of this journey, and I’d walk around a few small towns.  If nothing turned up, then that was it.  It was over.

“I don’t want you to do this.”

I looked at her and I nodded.  It was the next evening and Stephanie and I were at my apartment.  I was showing her the journals and the maps and the photographs.  I’d only mentioned them before; she’d never asked to see them and I’d never shown.  But when I told her what I was planning to do, she had me pull them all out.  The difference between hearing and seeing was probably too much for her all at once.  Between the phone call and the letter and seeing all of this for the first time, she was afraid to the point of being angry.  I didn’t blame her.

“I know.  I just don’t know any other way.”

“You’ll lose your job.”

“Maybe.  I’ll talk to Mike.  He might hold something for me.”

She was quiet for a few minutes.  “I’m afraid of this.  The whole thing.  I don’t want you to go.”

“I don’t want to go.  I want to be here, with you.  I… it’s weird.  I like my life here.  That may be a first for me.”

She smiled, but it was a tight smile.  “It’s dangerous.  These people… they’re dangerous.”

“I know.  That’s why I’m going to go.  I can’t keep you involved in this.”

She shook her head.  “That’s not fair.  I didn’t ask you to protect me.”

“I know you didn’t.  But I can’t… I can’t feel like I let you be hurt, harassed and frightened.  I can’t sit here and let you get put between these people and me.  I can’t.  Not if I could do something to stop it.”

She didn’t reply.  She picked up some of the photographs, stopped on one of her.  “Just… why?  What do they want?”

“I don’t know.  I really don’t.”

“But why you?”

I just shrugged and shook my head.  She put the pictures down and stood up, walking into the kitchen.  She opened the fridge and pulled out a pitcher of water, pouring herself a glass.  She stood in the kitchen and looked across the countertop at me.

“If you leave, I don’t know if things will work between us.  I don’t know if I can take you going off like that.”

“I know.”

“What do you mean, you know?”

“I mean I don’t expect you to wait around for me.  To deal with this kind of behavior.  It’s not fair to you, I know that.”

“But, you’re going to do it anyway.  To, what?  Protect me?”

“To protect us both.  I can’t live with this hanging over me.  You shouldn’t have to.”

She set her water on the counter and walked back over to the couch.  She sat down and she put her head on my shoulder and she held me, and I held her.  She cried.  I wanted to but couldn’t.
