Epistle Seven, that you might be resolute.

She is not dead, but sleeping only, though beneath what earth I do not know.  As she has lifted me so again must I rise, this dread morning now past, and no longer linger among the sorrowed pines.  They are tall and they ache with me for a loss, but young they too must repair, and with the wind whispering her name to us both, I stand.  I know not whither my road shall bend, nor what fate must lie farther on, and yet slow my step pulls forward that there beneath some distant sun we might meet again.

We are not given such grace as death, free from bonds of long spent moments, to forego such wounds as time.  Flicker, my life has passed, and she meets me only at the end, forgetting that once I was other than this lost and damaged thing.

But it is not mine to know, nor to accuse, but to lean only and ever on.  An angel of the rose exhorts atop the hill, and I bound up again, alive, where among so many I might make such solitary claim.  She loves as she does and no more, and what I would of her is naught but pride and petty want.  Stand, as I stand, neither rest nor weary.  We have begun, and though so near to home we are beyond its reach already, return a memory that will not come.  And if it is not faith I ask, it is will and time and patience yet, to place your step beside my own, until dust and sleep and sweat and hunger greet us on the way, and passing give their blessing only, that we might farther still.  What gain, I cannot answer, only lend you such hope as I have gathered - a hope unlike another, and beg you take into your breast.  As a tongue of fire burns, so too it fills with stillness, and with such flame there is not thirst nor weariness nor despair that might stay your hand or course.

Come, and listen to the angel, among her peaceful stones and boughs, her silent hand upraised to proclaim a wisdom I could not before her find.  And know that it is not I but you for whom she calls, from her place so wedded to the earth.

“I don’t really want to talk about it anymore, Chris.  Just drop it, alright?”

“I don’t see why you’re so pissed off.  I didn’t write anything on that photograph.”

“Y’know what?  Either you really believe that you didn’t, in which case you seriously need to be in a hospital for evaluation, or you’re lying to me.  I don’t really want to think about either of those possibilities right now, Ok?  Just leave it.”

“It’s not possible I’m both sane and telling the truth?”

“No.  I don’t see how.”

We’d been driving through northern Georgia all morning, and though we’d talked about other things, we kept circling back to this.  “What about when I saw the woman outside the bar?  That wasn’t much different.”

“You could have imagined that, or been mistaken about what you thought you saw.”

“So, you’re saying you didn’t believe that, either?”

“No, I didn’t.  I don’t.”

I was irritated, and felt like she was patronizing me.  “Well, why the hell did you come on this trip, then?”

She picked up one of the journals she’d been leafing through, held it up emphatically.  “These, Chris.  The journals are real, the photographs are real.  Someone wrote them, someone took the pictures.  And, no offense, I know it wasn’t you.  You don’t write like this, and you wouldn’t know how to fake the photographs, even if you wanted to.”

“Wait, so you can believe there’s a woman who kidnapped me and dragged me around the country when we were kids, and that neither of us remember anything about it, but you won’t buy that someone could scrawl a few words on the back of a photograph and leave it at a hotel room door?”

She sat staring silently out the window for a few minutes.  She turned back to look at me.  “The journals and photos are out of some history from a lifetime ago.  I don’t have to believe it all the way.  It’s like a puzzle, not a trap.  But if there’s someone following us, hiding, waiting to leave little unsettling messages… What do I do with that, Chris?  It scares me.  It’s too much for me to handle.  Just let me be angry for a while, alright?”

I didn’t answer.  There wouldn’t have been much else for me to say.

“Where are we heading, anyway?”

She picked up the map.  “Heart of Georgia.  Stay on 75 down through Atlanta, hit 475.  I’ll tell you when to turn off.”

“What are we looking for?”

“A very big, very old cemetery.”

“Why?”

“I’m the navigator.  You just drive.”

Though they should, cemeteries rarely remind of my own mortality.  I’ve tried, even, expecting that it’s to this end that my thoughts should turn, walking among somber angels - some severe, others comforting - and chunks of marble too weathered to read.  Tried to contemplate the death that must someday take me, and lay me like these to rest, the quick of me in a breath departing, and sinking like my bones into the ground.  But my thoughts among so many dead wouldn’t gladly stay lingering on my own demise, but branched out curiously among the living for whom such memorials are placed.  To think of what little we know of death but its inevitability.  Ideas so completely woven into the fabric of our hopes, beliefs, and dreaded fears - the spirits of the departed, as those we love beyond our grasp, or the haunting shade who will not rest.

We wandered among the gravestones and the twisting paths, down the roll of smaller hills revealing an unseen crypt or sepulcher, and further still within until we found crumbling headstones falling down, nearest to the river.  Standing we looked down across it, the trees against a gray-white sky, empty train tracks below them, tucked into the valley near the water as it passed.  There was a silence but it was not pregnant, just the stillness hushing from the stones and muffled footsteps, voices seeming unwilling to loudly play among the cracking monuments.

We had wandered for an hour or more, just looking, taking in the scope of the place.  High atop a hill and in its rolling grasses, towering trees like solemn and ancient guardians, we would stop and read inscriptions, look silently on sculptures and dedicated benches.  I finally asked.

“What are we looking for?”

Mallory reached into her purse, took out a photograph and handed it to me.  “This.”

It was a photograph of a stone angel, right hand in the air, her middle finger broken.  She held a scroll unwound in her left, and a garland of flowers about the same arm.  Before the angel in the photograph, I knelt on a single knee, my hand on it and my face turned upward, as if I was rising.  “You’re sure it’s in this cemetery?”

“No.  It’s my best guess though.”

I looked at the photograph for a bit longer, doing my best to memorize the angel, pick it out as distinct from among the others, then put it in my pocket.  “I could have been helping to look, you know.”

“Sorry.”  Her tone was still upset, and I let it rest.

“What do you think it means?”

She bent down and brushed her fingers over an inscription, then rose and turned to face me.  “I don’t know.  I don’t know what any of this means, if anything at all.”  Her face had a tear on it, and her eyes were red.

“Mal, what’s wrong?”

She shook her head.  “Nothing.”

“Why are you crying?”

“It’s nothing.  Let’s just walk, alright?”  She put an arm around me, which I wasn’t expecting.  I thought she was still angry with me.  I said nothing and put mine over her shoulder, and we walked.

So far we hadn’t seen anyone else among the graves, but as we came around a crypt house, there was a woman standing on the path.  She was looking down at a headstone, and coming upon her unexpected surprised me.  She looked up abruptly as we turned the corner.

I looked at her and smiled.  “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”

She was older, in her seventies or better.  She looked at me, her face warm, her smile friendly.  “No, no, not your fault.  I believe you caught me daydreaming.”

I looked up at the gray sky, the trees still and listening.  “It’s the right kind of day for it.”

She nodded.  “It is.”  She paused for a moment, then asked, “Do you have family here?”

“No, no one.  We’re just visiting.”

“It is a beautiful place, isn’t it?”

“Very much, yes.”  I smiled, but didn’t know what more to say.  “It was nice to have met you.  Sorry for the interruption.”

She patted me on the arm.  “Not at all.”

We walked a few steps away before it occurred to me that she might know where our stone angel would be.  I turned back around, and pulled the photograph from my pocket.  “Could I ask you a question?”

“Certainly.  I asked you one.”

I held the photograph out to her, and she took it.  “I was wondering if you knew where this monument might be.  We’re not even sure it’s in this cemetery.”

She reached into her purse and put on her glasses, holding the photo closer.  “Oh, yes.  You’re not very near it, I’m sorry to say.  It is farther on that way.”  She pointed the direction we were walking.  “I can walk with you to show you, if you like.”

“No, that’s not necessary.  Thank you though.  I’m sure we can find it.”

She extended the photograph back to me, but took my hand.  “I’m sure you can too, son.  But I would enjoy the walk and the company.”

She had a tissue in her hand it seemed more out of habit than any chance of tears, and whatever grief showed on her face was an old one.  I smiled and extended my hand.  “We would be glad of the help.”

She took my arm and walked between Mallory and I, though sometimes Mallory would have to drop back when the path was not wide enough for three.  I looked back at her but she smiled, as if to say it was fine.

“Does the angel mean anything to you?” the old woman asked.

“I’m sorry?”

“The angel in your photograph, with the little boy.  Does it mean something to you?  It’s just that you’re looking for it, but don’t know where it is, so I guess you haven’t been here before.”

“I… honestly, I don’t know.  I recently found this photograph.  The boy in it is me, but I don’t remember it being taken.  We were going to be driving this way anyway, so I thought I’d stop and take a look.”

She nodded, seeming to think for a moment.  “And you’re sure you want to find it?”

I looked at her curiously.  “What do you mean?”

She squeezed my hand, her face still smiling but drawn.  “Sometimes we forget things for good reasons.”

We walked for a while longer.  She would point to small bends to the right, then to the left.  We came to a line of trees, the path leading beyond them.  She nodded toward them.  “Through those trees there.”  She let go of my hand, and took a few steps to a bench, and sat down.  “Now look there, I’ve gone and made myself tired.  I’m going to rest a while.  Go on if you’re going to go.”

“Thank you, ma’am.”

She nodded, but was already looking in her purse, and waved a hand as if to move me along.

I passed through the trees, Mallory standing beside me.  She leaned over, though we were too far for the woman to hear, speaking quietly, a smile in her voice.  “Well, she was… nice.”

I grinned.  “She was.  A bit strange, but nice.”

“What was with the warning?”

“I don’t know.  Maybe she’s a witch.”

Mallory laughed at me, I laughed back.  We could see the statue ahead of us on the path, and a ring of graves all together, circled about the angel in the center.  We walked to the edge, both of us lingering outside the circle, looking in.

Mallory let go of my hand and rubbed her arms.  “I take it back, your witch was right.  This is creepy.”

I looked at the headstones.  They didn’t share a family name, nor similar dates.  The cut of the marble was different for each, the lettering done in distinct styles.  They were placed with the epitaphs facing in, toward the angel, as if the caskets lay looking toward her, inside the ring.  There were twelve headstones to make the ring, and as I looked I realized that the dates receded further back into history as they went around.  I took the photograph out and tried to match the angle from which it would have been taken.  The angel stood facing the northeast, and in the photograph I was looking at her face.  I found the grave nearest which it seemed like I would have knelt, three graves to the east from north.  Without much of a thought, I knelt before the angel as I had in the photograph.

I waited in the quiet, but I didn’t remember anything.  I looked at the monument, at the scroll she held in her hand, at the solemnity of her face.  I looked behind me at the names and dates, but they didn’t mean anything to me either.  I looked about me from side to side, but I remembered nothing, recognized nothing, not even plagued by some sense of deja vu, perhaps implying that I had been here once before.

I looked over at Mallory.  Her face was white, her body stiff.  Her arms were straight at her sides.  She was not looking at me, nor anything I could see, her gaze extending through me and the angel and the headstones and trees all together.  She began to speak.

“And among the twelve the first shall come, and he shall bear the burden of my waking.  Behold the child, come in innocence, now in grace, who with faulted word must make heard my own.  Look upon him, thrice abandoned; Attis marred, hung from the bough.  Stand!  You have knelt too long, and if you would die, do before the morning comes. For at its rise you may die no more.”

Mallory collapsed on the ground.  I leapt up and ran to her, frantic.  I clumsily checked for her pulse, but mine was racing too fast, and I couldn’t tell hers from my own in my fingertips.  I listened for breath and watched her chest, and could see that she was breathing.  I called to her, gently shaking her shoulder.  “Mal…  Mal, wake up.  Mallory, talk to me.”

She groaned, shifting her arm, her hand twitching.  She had a water bottle and I opened it, lightly sprinkling her face.  I didn’t know what else to do.  After a few moments her eyes flickered open.  “Chris?”  She reached for her head.  “What happened?”

I helped her sit up, handed her the water.  She didn’t drink it, just held it in front of her.  “I don’t know.  You started saying something, then fell down.”

She rubbed at her temples, pushed her hair back and looked up some.  “Saying what?”

“I don’t know, it doesn’t matter.  Are you alright?”

She nodded slowly.  “I think so.  My head hurts.” She touched her face, and looked at me.  “And it’s wet.  What did you do?”

I looked down, a sheepish smile on my face.  “I don’t know.  I was panicked.  I splashed some water on you.”

She looked at me and laughed.  “Did I have a sudden fever?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know.  You fell down, I freaked out a little.”

She wiped the water off her face with her forearm, laughing.  “Help me stand up.”

I did, and we walked back through the trees.

The old woman was gone when we passed back into the rest of the cemetery.  Mallory leaned on my arm and we walked slowly, stopping to rest when her head would hurt too much.  Eventually we made it to the car, picked a hotel for the night and stopped.  It seemed like we’d had enough excitement for one day, that we both could use some rest.  The room was better than the last, if not by much, and Mallory took one of the beds and fell asleep almost immediately.  I took her shoes off and pulled the blanket over her.  I picked up one of the room keys and went to get some ice.

I couldn’t help but worry she was getting worse.  Whatever that was in the cemetery wasn’t like her, not even when she wasn’t on her medication.  The look on her face, frozen like that, gone pale and stiff.  It scared me.  Almost certainly was the same kind of thing Mike had warned me about.  I wondered if we should be on this trip at all, if I should call Mike and tell him about what was going on.  He’d certainly want her to come back home.  I was afraid I’d made a serious mistake, misjudging how sane she really was, how capable to be out here doing something like this.  Too lost in thought, I walked past the ice machine entirely, realized it was behind me and had to turn back around.  I filled up the bucket and went back to the room.

“So, what did I say?”

It was later, Mallory was sitting cross-legged on the bed, blanket pulled around her feet.  Half a pizza on the table still, her plate and a crust beside her.

“I don’t really remember.”  She looked at me skeptically, but I spoke before she could press again.  “Anyway, what do you remember?”

She shrugged, leaned back against the headboard.  “Not much.  You were kneeling in the circle of headstones, figured you were trying to see if being in the same spot would help you remember.  The whole thing looked creepy, I was about to tell you so.”  She stopped, pushing the crust around on her plate, looking down.  “I don’t know after that.  It was like I was still there, I was choosing to say those words, only they weren’t mine.  I don’t know where they came from.  Everything began to kind of shiver, or ripple.  It’s hard to describe.”

“And then what?  Passing out?”

She nodded, not looking up.  “Yeah.  I felt like something in me went slack.  I remember my knees feeling suddenly like water, and then nothing until you were shaking me.”  She paused for a minute, then looked back at me.  “You really don’t remember what I said?”

I put my plate on the table, leaned back in the chair.  “Some, I guess.  A child, something about words.  Dying before the morning.  I don’t know.  Was it something from the journals, maybe?  Some part I don’t remember?”

She shook he head.  “I don’t think so.  If it was, I wasn’t quoting on purpose.”

I looked at her, she still seemed shaken, her face too pale.  “Mal, are you Ok?  We can cut this whole thing short.  If you need to go home, or just want to stop, it’s alright.”

“I’m Ok.”

“How do you know?”

She didn’t answer, though eventually she spoke again.  “I had this weird feeling that it was talking about you.”

“What?”

“I don’t know, whatever put the words in my head.  I think it was talking about you.”

“Nothing puts words into your head, Mal.  They came from somewhere, sure, but in you.  Probably reading the journals, some of the stress of the trip.  Something like that.”

She didn’t respond.

Mallory had gone back to sleep, I had my notebook out and was trying to write some things down.  I couldn’t shake the day from me, this image in my head that was forming of something talking through Mallory, talking about me.  I felt haunted, more by the scene than by the words I could remember.  I could have dismissed words, anything at all could have come spilling out of her mouth, insisting on no certainty of meaning.  But the vision of kneeling before a stone angel, the same as when I was a child, and my sister speaking strange words into the afternoon air as a thing possessed - it shook me, however much I reasoned it away.

Worse, her intuition that it was speaking to me made a kind of disconcerting sense.  Reading the journals I had been unable to abandon a notion that they had been written with me in mind.  Why send them to me if not intended for me?  And I was the one in the photographs.  While reading them, I had felt like they had been written to me personally, or at least aware that I would read them.  That they were about me seemed a notion I couldn’t reasonably dispute, though I felt chafed by the vanity of the assumption.

And if it was me who was supposed to finish this journey, and about whom the journals were written, then what did it mean that Mallory was spontaneously prophesying, believing her words to be intended for me?  I was nothing.  I had no job, no relationship, no degree, no plans, no dreams.  I had a car packed with some bags and a cooler, a sister on medication, and propaganda for a goddess that didn’t exist.  Why would I be here, now, following after that same goddess?  What was my hope, what purpose could I possibly serve?  Supposing it was true, that there was a goddess about whom the madwoman wrote.  There had to be someone better suited to the task.  Someone better suited to divining even what it was the task should be.

I left the room and walked, unable to sit and write any longer.  I couldn’t stand the thought of any of it, true or false.  Neither way seemed to offer any better option.  What if there were such a goddess?  I could never manage to believe in just the one God, much less many or other.  I saw only little use to them.  That we would put so far off our own hopes, and write the same into figures too remote to reach, too sacred to ever more than passing know.  And in our yearning to answer why, we would seek out the divine, though begging of them gave no greater hope of answer than we already had of ourselves.  Did we need them to reach into our breasts, and shape a knowledge of an arbitrary rule, a division of good and evil that was never wholly our own?  It seemed as if we had only just begun to cast from our hands the crutch of these failing masters, and to stand for the first time on our own.  Were there greater hells that they had not ever clamored for us to endure?  From what atrocities had flowed more blood than they would gladly drink?  And should there be such a goddess, what course could I have that would not hope only to defy and strike her down?

I walked along the sidewalks, the sun long set, passing from one pool of streetlamp light to the next.  Apartment complexes with people through the windows, watching TV and making dinner.  An old man walking toward me with a cane, nodding and smiling as he passed.  The rush of cars as they went by, headlights bright.  A man and woman on a bench, holding one another close, talking quietly and laughing.  A baby crying through a window, sirens in the distance speeding to some emergency.  Someone swearing loudly, someone else laughing that they’d done so.  So many lives.  Did they need some promise of another world, one transformed beyond their comprehension?  Were we not enough, alone?

As I walked, in front of me a crow landed on the sidewalk, and began to peck at a dead squirrel or rat, something killed by traffic.  My steps took me near it, but it didn’t move, it just turned its head and looked at me, and deciding I was no threat, went back to the carrion before it.  I walked farther on, and found myself in an older section of town.  There were an increasing number of abandoned buildings, houses fallen into disrepair.  A few were little more than sticks of wood, or concrete block, gutted and empty, plants having begun to reclaim them.  From one house that was all but vanished into decay, a tree was growing through the foundation, its branches twisting through where a window once opened, the uppermost branches winding through holes in the roof.  Vines had wrapped about much of the rest of the structure, as if soon it might be pulled wholly back into the earth.  Without thinking clearly I walked to it, and pulled open the door.  It protested as it opened but did not just then collapse.  I walked inside, and pulling out my cellphone as a flashlight, and looked around the corners of the room.  It was empty, but for the tree.  Graffiti on the walls, tags and slurs and insults.  The tree itself had been carved into over and over, names and heart shapes and all the rest, like it was a bathroom stall.  And yet it grew, the foliage thick and clear of disease, strong roots pushing through the concrete.  I put my hand on the trunk, and for some moments thought of nothing.

There was a rumbling in the distance, and a flash of lightning flickered through the window.  I left, turning back, and made it to the hotel room just before it began to rain.

“Where’d you go?”

“Just for a walk.”

She sat up, slid her legs over the side of the bed.  “Everything Ok?”

I shrugged.  “I think so.  Weird couple of days, is all.”

“Yeah.  I’m sorry.”

“It’s not your fault.”

She stood up, stretching.  “I’m sorry I didn’t believe you about the note.  I really don’t know what I think happened.  But I’m sorry I was angry about it.”

“It’s alright.  Driving has made us both tired.  I’m sure we’re both a little on edge.”

“Probably so.”

“Did you sleep well?”

“Some.  Dreams didn’t let me rest as much as I’d like.”

“Bad ones?”

“Not really.  Just anxious.”

I didn’t answer for a second, then looked over at her.  “You’re still taking your meds, aren’t you?”

She didn’t answer immediately.  When she did, the look on her face was already hardened, ready to fight.  “Why?”

“Are you or aren’t you?”

“No.”

“God dammit.”  I took a deep breath.  “When did you stop?”

She shrugged.  “Same day they let me go.”

“Shit.”  I stood up from the chair and paced a few steps, turning to look at her.  “We talked about this before we left.  You promised.”

“They make me… it’s like I’m blurred out.  Tired, only half there.”

“Mal, that episode today was very likely from not taking them.  You know that as well as I do.”

“It’s better than feeling like I’ve been switched off.”

I didn’t say anything for a few minutes, just walking back and forth.  I stopped and turned to her.  “Well, what are we going to do about it?  What do you expect me to do?  I can’t risk you getting worse by having you on this trip if you’re not going to stick to what we agreed on.”

“Are you seriously threatening me that you’ll turn the car around and take me back home?”

“I don’t know what else to do, Mallory.  It’s dangerous for you like this.”

She stood up walked toward the back, leaned on the sink and counter that was outside the bathroom, and looked at me from the reflection in the mirror.  “It’s dangerous no matter how we do this.  You knew that when you brought me along.”

I didn’t respond.  She kept looking at me and continued.  “You wanted to do this, and you didn’t want to do it alone.  Don’t pretend otherwise.  You wanted me here, and you knew from the start that I might very likely stop taking my medication.  You took the risk because you didn’t want to be out here, trying to find yourself or whatever it is we’re doing, all on your own.”

“That’s not true.  We talked about it.”

“Right, sure.  I promised you something you knew I wouldn’t stick to.  You don’t get to use that as a free pass against some responsibility.  I’m not taking my pills anymore.  That’s my choice.  But you knew I just might stop, that there was a pretty good chance.  And you didn’t care.  You made me promise just so you wouldn’t have to feel guilty about it.  Not because you believed it.”

I couldn’t respond for a while.  When I did, I was almost surprised to hear the words come out of my mouth.  “You’re right.”

She turned around and took a few steps toward me.  “What?”

“You’re right.  I knew you might stop.  I decided it was worth the risk.  I didn’t want to be alone out here.”

Her face seemed torn between anger and surprise.  “Well, that’s pretty shitty of you, isn’t it?”

“Yeah.  I guess it is.”

She sat down on the edge of the bed.  I stood there quietly.  Eventually she looked over at me.  I expected her to be crying, but she wasn’t.  She had the ghost of a smile, though her face was tense.  “Sometimes it’s better when you’re not perfect.”

“What?”

“It’s relieving.  When you’re selfish, I mean.  You take care of me, come get me from the hospital, bring me places I wouldn’t be able to go alone.  You talk to doctors for me, and send me money.  Sometimes it’s actually nice when you do something shitty.  It makes me feel less like you’re this perfect brother I can never make it all up to.”

“Mal, it’s not like that at all.”

She laughed, brushed at her eye though I still didn’t see any tears.  “Sure it is.  Even you think so sometimes.  The unwilling martyr, always taking care of his sister, putting everything on hold for her.”

“I don’t mean it like that.”

“I know you don’t.  Sometimes it doesn’t matter how you mean it.  It just is what it is.”

She sat there quietly and I stood still, neither of us sure what the next thing to say should be.  I could hear the thump and creak of water in the pipes as people in other rooms turned on showers and flushed toilets.  Could hear the murmur of conversations on TV through the walls.

Eventually I said, “I love you, Mal.  You’re my sister.  I’d do anything I can for you.”

“I know.  I love you, too.”

After a while she picked up the remote and turned on the TV, I went to the bathroom and took a shower.  We went to bed without saying anything else.

I couldn’t sleep, lying there staring at the ceiling.  Probably should have been from guilt, but it didn’t feel like it.  More that I just couldn’t rest, not tired enough to let sleep take me.  I looked across the room at Mallory lying in her bed, her breath coming slow and steady.  I didn’t want to worry her by leaving for another walk, didn’t want to wake her by turning on a lamp or the TV.  I’d packed a few books, and I picked up the backpack that had them and slipped into the bathroom quietly, thinking I could read by the light in there without disturbing her.

I stretched a towel out on the tiles and sat down, and pulled open my bag.  A few novels, things I’d meant to read.  Brought them along whenever I went on trips, almost as much out of guilt for not having read them than any hope that I might read them this time.  I pushed them aside.  At the bottom, where I’d forgotten I packed it, was The Very Long Journey.  I must have put it with my things when Mallory left it for me.  I flipped open the cover, and looked at the yellowing pages.  The corners and edges of the paper were nicked and dented, like the book had seen a lot of use, or abuse.  I paged through the illustrations, thinking I should probably read something else, something more adult.  But Mallory had said it reminded her of the journals.

I flipped back to the first page, and I started to read.
