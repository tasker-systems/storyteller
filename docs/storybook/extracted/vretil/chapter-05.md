Epistle Seventeen, because she is gone.

Without answer we walk blind.  Was it the gods from whom we sought reply?  Pray it is not so, for they are woeful silent.  And yet such questions as ache in my breast linger still unanswered, and I can find no way forward save by stumbling, faulted step.  That she were not gone.  At her great distance she shines so little light; the star is only as beauty, without aid but of hope, and that too slight to more than slip softly past.

Was there ever any within my reach?  The child sleeps, the other marches on, alone.  His tiny steps sound lonely in the wilderness, and I know not where his path will lead.

Without answer.  Demons if they would, I would raise them up to gods and damn whatever world might come behind, but that they might impart to me by lash or whisper such secrets as lie yet unuttered.  I am so weary of being blind.  Beggar made of heaven with my palms upraised, in sorrow hide my face, pride no more a burden I must bear, only that some word must speak.  Teach, for even my questions are too small.  Speak, though I be blasted from the earth.  And if such word will not come then from so miserly a hand we will pluck the flame, and chain the god to his very rock.  Speak.  I can no more wait still and silent, eyes sealed tight against the dark.

So my wrath declares.  But to a face long absent, a smile that moves no more on lips that do not answer.  No ear that might hear my cry, my voice too small to carry far.  And I wonder if it is we who are lost, or she.

-----

I picked a fight at work.  For an angry moment it was like I wasn’t driving, rage pouring up through me over something insignificant.  I started shouting and someone shouted back.  I shoved him and he shoved me back.  One of the line cooks got between us before I could do anything really stupid, and I got sent home for the day, certain I overheard my manager talking to the owner about firing me.  It didn’t matter.  Something was wrong, a burden weighing on me that wouldn’t relent, an uneasiness of spirit that made me feel vulnerable and unbalanced.  Easily assailed.

Alone at home I felt like crying.  That wasn’t something I was used to.  I’d find myself sitting silently on the couch, my eyes would be hot and I’d find water on my face and for a moment I’d have to think of where it came from.  I didn’t understand what was going on inside me.  I felt like screaming, only there was no one to scream at.  I showed up to work drunk, just sober enough to hide it.  Or so I hoped, though no one was saying anything to me about it either way.  I felt like I should get fired for my behavior, but they were letting it go.  It made me want to try harder, to get some kind of response.  Like something else was in my brain, something other than me, a ball of hurt and fear pushing up from my belly, giving rise to some other self.  I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from.

I didn’t see or hear from Mallory for a week after she left that evening.  I looked through the notebooks and the photographs, especially those she’d placed between pages, but reading the entries near the photographs gave me no better clue.  I bought a little notebook of my own, and began to take notes.  It felt alien, a pen in my hand and fresh, blank pages.  My notes became paragraphs, whole pages where, though I may have started with some thought of the journals, continued instead down winding and unexpected trails of thought, wandering into a darkened wood that I wouldn’t have suspected lurked so readily at hand.  My notebook wasn’t precise, no clear record of anything but my own dramatics being played out in uncomfortable fits and starts.

I came home early one evening and found Mallory in my living room, looking out the window just after the sun had set.

“When did you come in?”

For a few moments she didn’t speak, as if she hadn’t heard, or the words took time to bore through some cocoon of silent distance wrapped about her.  When she looked around, her eyes were far away, drawing their focus to me only slowly and with effort.

“Chris, you’re home.  I didn’t hear you.”

“Me?  When did you get here?”

“Oh,” she said.  “A while ago.”  She turned her head as if she would drift off out the window again.  I walked to her and took her arm.

“Mal, what’s wrong with you?”

She blinked, beginning to rouse.  “What?  Nothing.”

“You sure?  You seem… tired.”

She nodded.  “I feel tired.  But it’s alright, I’ve figured something out.”  She looked around the room.  “Where are the photographs and journals?  I’d like to show you.”

We walked over to the couch, and she sat down.  I pulled the box out and set it on the coffee table, Mallory pulled a map from her purse and spread it out, pushing the box to one side.  The map was of the U.S., and she’d drawn lines and circled city names across the eastern seaboard and down across the south, stretching across to the southwest.  She picked up the photographs and began to lay them out along her lines or next to the circled cities.  “This is where she took you.”

“What do you mean?”

She pointed at the first picture she had placed, the one of me facing the sun, my arms open.  “This is home, or close enough.  This is you at your youngest.”  She gestured to the next few.  “You see how you get older in these, as we move along?”

I nodded.  “Yeah, I can see that.  Those photos are from a bunch of different trips.”

She shook her head.  “For you.  But for her it was all one.”

“All one what?”

“One trip.  It’s in the way she writes.  She may have brought you back home after a week or two each time you both went out, but to her there was no discontinuity between where one trip ended and the next began.  She would just take you a little farther along in each one.”

“Why?”

“I can’t tell.  There are lots of things that I think should be hints, but she never says, and I can’t discern a meaning behind them.”

I looked down the series of photographs, a single long excursion spread out over different instances in time, my age increasing by sudden jumps.  The end was in the middle of nowhere, not even a city, just the end of her red line on the paper.  “Where does it stop?”

“It doesn’t.”

I pointed to the paper.  “Your red line ends.”

“I know.  But the trip itself… I don’t think it ever ended.  She never finished taking you wherever it was she was planning.  It’s like the last leg of the journey was left incomplete.”

“How do you know that?”

She shook her head a little.  “I don’t, not for sure,” she pointed back to the end of the line.  “But there’s no ending to it.  She doesn’t say what has happened, or what was supposed to happen.  There are plenty of passages that talk about the end, but nothing that seems like either of you ever reached it.”

I sat back, unsure what to say, what to make of any of it.  “I don’t understand.  Why leave the trip unfinished?”

Mallory looked down at the map, righting the angles of some of the photographs, hesitating.  “I don’t know.  The journals end without saying.  Maybe she died.  Or maybe someone finally noticed that she was taking you places, and stopped her.”

“Do you think that’s what happened?”

She was quiet, then looked up.  “No.  Or I don’t think that’s what matters out of it.”

“What, then?”

She stood up and walked back to the window.  There was frustration in my voice that I didn’t mean to let sound.  “Mal, come on.  What do you think happened?”

She turned and looked at me.  “You remember the photograph you said you got from the bottom?  The one that says she’s waiting.”

“Yeah.”

“The journey.  I think you’re supposed to finish it.”

We talked.  I got heated once or twice, angry for no better reason than that this made me uncomfortable.  This notion that there was a journey waiting to be completed, a woman who had taken me from whatever home I was in, and dragged me across the country.  A kidnapper that took photographs and kept a psychotic diary about it.  Mallory showed me passages in the journals to explain how she’d figured out the places she’d settled on, and how she’d arranged the photographs to match.  There were fewer than a dozen sites she was sure of, but the path it seemed to trace was indisputable, if I could agree to the premise.

I didn’t like it, but the more she showed me, the less my dislike mattered.  From the moment she’d said it, I’d felt like it was true, resonating almost as soon as she’d finished telling me the first time.  The thoughts I’d had while reading the journals seemed to fit into the explanation.  The woman who wrote these journals hadn’t died, or if she had, that wasn’t the reason her bizarre quest had ended.  To her way of thinking, she had never stopped at all.  It was only that time had to catch up to me, the journey still ongoing, so that she could continue.

Mallory pointed to circled or marked places on the map.  I tried again to remember something, anything, of having been there in my childhood, but came up blank each time.  I could remember being eight.  Eleven.  But I couldn’t remember the places, the images in the photographs.  We talked about what might be waiting at each stop, why those places in particular.  We talked about what the progression of the postures might mean, what the photographs were meant to represent.  Why some were matched with places and dates, when others were not.  We talked about what sites were most clearly distinguishable from others, what cities they were nearest.  We talked about what route would be most reasonable to follow by picking out roads on a map.

It seemed like the decision was made in passing.  We argued about details and we looked at roads and the cities they connected.  We jabbed at the map emphatically with the same red pen.  And in the midst of it, I realized that I had decided to go.  Somewhere between debating the specifics of the wording in a journal entry and its relation to a city or a national park, I realized that I was going to do this.  It broke over me in a wave and I sat back, laughing.

“This is madness.”

Mallory laughed too, her eyes very bright.

I was quiet for a moment, and I looked at her still smiling.  “I think we should do it.”

“What do you mean?”

“We should go.  We should just get on the road and follow this thing to the end.”

She looked at me, her face full of surprise.  “Do you mean that?”

I nodded.  “Yeah.  I think I do.”

“What will you do about work?”

“I don’t know.  Quit, I guess.  I’m close to getting fired anyway.”

“This is crazy.”

“That part you would know better than me.”

She smiled, hesitating for a moment, then spoke more softly than before.  “A few hours ago, I didn’t even know if I should tell you about this.  I thought you’d laugh at me, or be upset.  That you’d think it was really insane.”

“It probably is.”

“Why then?  Why go?”

“I…”  I paused.  I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.  I turned to face her, and when I spoke my voice was quiet.  “Something’s wrong.  Like inside me somewhere.”

“What do you mean?”

I shook my head.  “It’s hard… hard to say it right.  I feel like something’s broken, something I can’t see.  Like it’s broken and making me do things I don’t want to do, act in ways I don’t want to act.”

She nodded, but didn’t answer.

“I sometimes feel like I never actually woke up, you know?  Like I’m asleep and this is my life but I don’t know where it came from or how it got to where it is.  Like I’m blurred out, half dreaming all the time, only long empty silent moments having any kind of reality to them, and those only of a kind that make me wish I was still asleep instead.”

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s not your fault.”

She shook her head.  “I’m sorry you’ve felt that way.  Sorry that I haven’t seen it.”

“It’s Ok.  I’m probably being melodramatic.”

“It doesn’t sound that way.”

We were both quiet for a few moments, nothing more to say.  I sat forward and looked at the map again.  “Do you want to go?  I mean really?”

She nodded.  “I do.”

“When do you want to try to leave?”

“I doesn’t matter.  I can be ready as soon as you are.”

I’d just finished closing down the back, the last of the dishes drying in racks.  I walked into my boss’s office.  “You got a minute?”

He looked up from a stack of paperwork.  “Yeah, I guess.  What do you need, Chris?”

I shut the door behind me and walked over, sitting in one of the folding chairs in front of his desk.  It wasn’t a terribly nice office, no windows, as much a closet as anything.  Walls that had been white at some point but were now closer to yellow-gray.  He looked at me, waiting.  I cleared my throat.  “Thing is, I’m going to be away for the next month.”

“As of when?”

“Today.  Today needs to be my last day.”

He put his papers down, obviously irritated.  “Well, that’s some great timing, Chris.  You ever hear of putting in your two weeks?  It’s not just a turn of phrase.”

I nodded.  “I know.  I’m sorry.  Something’s just come up.”

“Something that’s going to make you gone for a month?”  He shook his head and sighed.  “I’ve been pretty tolerant of this shit, Chris.  Coming in late, your little screw ups, all the rest of it.  I know about your sister, and I’m sorry.  But this is really the last straw.”

“It’s alright.  I don’t expect you to hold my job for me.”

“Hold your job?  Chris, you’re fired, as of right now.  Just as well you’re quitting, because really, I’m sorry, but you’re not going to be re-hirable around here.”

“Whatever.  Seriously, that’s fine.  I’m not planning on coming back.”

“Just as well then.  Tell Tammy on your way out that it’s your last day.  She’ll get an address to mail your final check.”

I hadn’t gotten around to telling John that Mallory and I were planning to take this trip.  I felt like he would just worry, so I’d kept it from him until things were in place.  The day before we were going to leave, I gave him a call.

“Hi, John.”

“Chris, how are you, son?”

“I’m good.  Better than I’ve been in a while, really.”

“Good to hear.”

“I wanted to call to let you know.  Mallory and I are going to be taking a trip for the next few weeks, maybe a month.  Not sure how long it will take.  Just going to drive, sight-see, things like that.  Go south from here, then out west.”

“What do you mean, son.  You and Mallory?”

“She feels like it might do her good to get away from here for a while.  I feel the same.”

I heard him take a deep breath.  “Son, I’m worried about you.”

“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.  The trip will do us both some good.”

“Chris, have you talked to Dr. Nelson?  Or anyone?”

“Should I?  We’ve got Mal’s medication, and she’ll be with me.  We’ll be Ok.”

He didn’t speak again for a few moments.  When he did, his voice was resigned.  “Drive safely, son.”

“I will.  Thanks.”

I had trouble falling asleep that night.  Apprehension and excitement, running over checklists of things packed and things still to do early in the morning.  Tracing over the map in my head, thinking of cities and places I’d never been.  Nagging thoughts of practicality, what a bad idea quitting my job was, driving across the country with my sister who needed to stay calm and medicated.  Thinking I needed a better reason for this than a vague hope of finding where some old photographs were taken, searching for something I couldn’t even name with any certainty.  But I felt, too, like I’d turned a kind of corner.  Hoping that I might begin to live my life as if it were not a flight from, but a journey to, something else.  And if I wasn’t content, I liked the idea that I was at least seeking more than fleeing.

When I finally slept, it didn’t seem long before there was a girl before me in my dream, a pretty girl not much younger than me, crying into her hands.  Though I went to comfort her, she wouldn’t respond, and finally I was forced to take her by the shoulder and shake her gently until she began to rouse.  She looked up at me with tearful eyes and asked “Why do you trouble me?”

I dropped down to my knee, and looked up at her.  “I did not mean to do so, miss, but you were crying, and I wondered if I might help?”

“There is no one who can help me,” she replied sorrowfully.  “My brother has gone away, beyond a dark river, and will not return.”

I smiled, trying to brighten her shadowed face.  “Perhaps I can retrieve your brother for you.  I am not afraid of a dark river.”

She shook her head, tears flowing freely.  “No, it is no use.  He is held in a wood by a wicked old woman, and she binds him fast there, such that he has forgotten me.”

I stood, my smile broader still.  “I am certainly not afraid of an old woman.  I will fetch your brother for you.”

She did not answer, but reached into her basket and pulled out a purple flower.  She handed it to me.  “You will need this to travel to the hidden place where the old woman lives.”

I extended my hand and took it.  My dream changed, and suddenly I was standing atop a hill, looking down across a deep, dark river, and beyond it a dense wood.  In my dream, John came to my side.  It did not seem strange to see him there.  “Son, you do not want to go into that wood.  There is nothing for you there, and the child that you seek will not return with you.”

I did not believe him, but set off down the hill with great speed, and when I came to the dark river, I bounded across it in a long stride.  Looking back behind me, the river was far more broad than it had been from the other side, such that I could scarcely see John still atop the farther hill.  I bent down to take a drink, thinking perhaps I should refresh myself before entering the wood, when the water looked back at me, and from my reflection, spoke.

“You would do well to wet your tongue with another drop than mine.”

“But river,” I replied.  “I am thirsty, and you are so broad and deep.  Would a drop worry you, were it gone?”

“It is not my drops that worry me, but that you might not find them to your liking.  They are not for the mouths and throats of mortal men.”

But I did not listen, and I drank a drop from my cupped hand.

And I woke, though not bolting upright, feeling strange, as if something had passed by me as I slept.

I sat up and flipped on the light, there was nothing near me but the bed, the sound of the air conditioner coming on.  The clock said it was nearly time for me to get up anyway, so I did and showered.  The dream gradually drifted from me, but I thought it had been strange.  A trip in the dream and a trip I was about to go on, with John expressing some concern, I decided I knew well enough where it had come from, what it meant, though it left me feeling unsettled.

I was packing the box of photographs and journals, getting ready to put them in the car, when my eye fell on one photograph in particular.  In it, I was standing with my hand on the woman’s shoulder, and she was sitting on a park bench, her head down, her face buried in her hands as if she was weeping.  I couldn’t have been more than five or six in the picture, though it was not one we had placed on the map with any certainty.  I pulled it from the stack of the others and slipped it into my shirt pocket, and finished packing the car.

I’d gone back inside to pick up the cooler of ice and sandwiches I’d put together.  It wouldn’t be enough for more than a day or two, but was something to get us started.  Mallory was inside, sitting on the couch.  I smiled at her.  “Morning.  I thought I was going to pick you up at your place.”

She looked up and shrugged.  “I didn’t sleep much, woke up pretty early.  I thought I’d walk over instead.”

“It’s a nice morning for it.”

“It is, yeah.”

I picked the cooler up and began to walk to the car.  She stood up and followed me out the door.  I turned my head back toward her.  “I didn’t sleep well either.  Couldn’t fall asleep for a long time, and when I did, had some vivid dreams.”

“Anything interesting?”

I set the cooler down on the ground, opened the back door of the car.  I picked the cooler back up set it inside.  “I don’t know.  Weird, mostly.  Look at this though.”  I took the photograph out of my shirt pocket and handed it to her.  “I had a dream last night of a girl crying, her face in her hands.  I saw that photograph when I woke up.  Probably just coincidence, but weird, right?”

She took the photograph, looked at it.  “I guess.  You probably saw it before you went to sleep, especially if it was on the top for you to see it this morning.”

“Probably, yeah.  Nothing important, just thought I’d show you.”

She smiled.  “You have everything ready?”

I looked in the car, did a last mental walkthrough of what I’d packed, what we’d need.  “I think so.  Let me go check.”  I walked back into the apartment, looked around.  Food, drinks, some books, my new notebook, the photographs and journals, our map, a bag of clothes and toiletries, a camera, a few other odds and ends.  I couldn’t think of anything else important enough to bring along.  I walked back out, shut off the lights, and locked the door behind me.  “I think that’s it.  You ready to go?”

She turned and unexpectedly gave me a hug.  She was smiling brightly, and I hugged her back.  “I am now.”

We stopped to get gas on the way out of town.  I realized at the gas station that we only had the one map, and it was covered in lines and circles.  Since it didn’t have any clear detail by state or region, either, I went inside and found another with better detail.  I picked it up and walked to the counter.

“That it for you?”

“Yeah, that’s it.”

The cashier looked down, face passive, and began to flip through my map while the receipt printed.  “Where you headed?”

“Not entirely sure.  Just driving.”

“Tryin’ to get to something, or away from it?”

“What?”

She looked at me, same expressionless mouth, eyes.  She held on to the map for a few seconds, then set it down, sliding it to me.  “Nothing.”

She put the receipt on top of it, didn’t say anything else.  I picked it up and left, got back in the car.  Mallory had put on the radio, and was flipping through stations.  I handed her the map.

“The lady inside was weird.”

“How so?”

“She stared at me and asked if I was trying to get to, or away from, something.”

Mallory looked at the map, turned it over and looked at both covers, smiling.  “Is there a special kind of map for that?”

I smiled, relaxing.  “It was just strange.”

She laughed, tossed the map on the floor.  “Well, then we won’t pay attention to it for now, how about that?  You don’t need a map to drive south for a while.”

“True enough.”

There was a goddess in the journals.  The woman who wrote them seemed to believe so, anyway.  Enough to be in love with her, when she wasn’t angry for some indecipherable reason.  I wasn’t sure what a goddess like that was supposed to be, and it wasn’t the kind of thing I could get very far in understanding.  Green walls of trees slid by us as I drove, the hypnosis of it making my mind return again and again to the same question without effort.  If our trip had a patron, it might as well be this goddess.  What I couldn’t understand was my connection, how I fit, either now or then.  If the woman had lost her lover, why was I pulled in, to seek her out in kind?  There seemed to be no method for divining a course through such narrow straits as her madness, but I tried.  Lost among the puzzles of the woman’s reasoning, it didn’t take much to see that she had no firm grip on sanity.  I worried for the journal’s influence on Mallory’s state of mind, and at least in some degree on my own.

Madness was no stranger to my thoughts.  Behavior, not reasoning, always seemed - in my experience - to best define a disconnect from reality.  Long years with Mallory and she would, within her sphere, reason more clearly and cleverly than I could hope to.  But the world around her never felt obligated to constrain itself to the limits of that reason.  It was in behavior, the pattern beyond the moment’s conscious intent, that for me most illuminated the nature of her illness.  And it was my own behavior now that worried me.  I had left behind a life I knew and embraced this rash decision, to drive and to seek after something I hadn’t yet so much as clearly named.  To finish a journey I did not willingly begin.  But, though it worried me, I had no plan but to carry on, and hope that on the other side some reason might emerge upon which I could pin my deeds, though they bore them out not before I began.

I didn’t know this goddess, nor did she know she me.  I believed in her as no more than the cohering stuff of a madwoman’s hopes, the ephemeral mist arising at the edges of her pen’s scratchings, unreal and yet to me not wholly false, a catalyst of this journey however much a figment she might be.  I glanced over at Mallory, her head against the door.

“Hey, you asleep?”

She blinked and shifted in her seat, turning her head to look at me without sitting up.  “Hmm?”

“I asked if you were asleep.”

She put a hand to her eyes and rubbed them, sitting up.  “No, just resting.”

“Looked like you were asleep.”

“If I was, why’d you wake me up?”  She turned and reached behind us, opened up the cooler in the back seat.  “You want anything to eat?”

“No, not yet.  Some water would be nice, though.”

She rattled through the ice, turned back around with two bottles of water and a sandwich.  She handed me a bottle, began to unwrap the sandwich.

“What’d you make?”

“Just ham and turkey.  All I had at home.”

She took a bite.  “How’re you doing on driving?  Want me to take over?”

I shook my head.  “No, I’m fine.  Kinda enjoying it.”

“Better you than me.”

She ate in silence for a few minutes before I decided to ask her.  “So, what do you make of the goddess in the journals?”

She finished a bite, unscrewing the lid on her water.  “What do you mean?”

“Like, is she a goddess out of mythology or what?”

She shrugged.  “I don’t know, she could be.  I don’t recognize her, but there are so many, and so many versions of the same ones that go by different names in different places.  Or that got absorbed into other deities.  Too hard to really say.”

“Is she crazy?”

She laughed.  “The goddess?”

“No, you know what I mean.”

She was still smiling.  “I do.  And yeah, I think she’s crazy.  Why?”

“I don’t know.  Trying to figure out how insane I am for doing this at all.”

Mallory was quiet for a moment.  I glanced to the side, she was looking at me seriously.  “A little.  If I’d gone off and done it on my own, you and the doctors and everyone would have certainly stepped in.  Probably rightly.”

“Yeah.”

“Are you having second thoughts?”

“Some.  I want to do it.  If nothing else we’ll get to spend some time together, and we’ll both be out of town for a while.  But yeah.  I’m wondering if my thinking is getting frayed at the edges.”

“I don’t know.  It’s possible.  Don’t worry though, I’ll keep an eye on you.”  She began to laugh, and without really intending to, I laughed in return.

We stopped at a rest area, both went to the bathroom, I got back out first.  I didn’t get back in the car, just leaned against the door, looking up at the trees.  It wasn’t autumn yet, but it was coming soon enough.  The breeze was still warm, the bright greens of the spring had given way to the deeper ones of summer, some beginning to seem faded in the sun.  They’d begin to turn soon, lighting up the hillsides with blazes of orange and yellow and red.  For now though it was warm, early afternoon sunlight coming down, I closed my eyes and let my thoughts drift.

From picnic tables I could hear the voices of children and parents, eat your lunch, you’re going to be hungry later, but mom, I don’t like it.  On vacation or moving or visiting family, trips together that were very much unlike anything I knew.  For Mallory and me there hadn’t been a grandma’s house to go to, no aunt and uncle’s cabin on the lake.  It was nice though to think that this little family was doing something like that, maybe going camping, hiking through the hills together.  I missed it like I wanted to go back to it, though I’d never been, nostalgia for a thing that never was.  As kids Mallory and I would sometimes sneak away and stay gone all night, having secreted away a sleeping bag or blanket, just to be away for a while.  We’d get in trouble when we came home, but it was worth it to be out under the stars, our breath showing in the cold air, for those hours not orphans dumped in home that scarcely wanted them, but instead rebels and runaways, living off the land, wild and free.  It hadn’t mattered that it wasn’t real, that we’d known we’d go home in time for breakfast the next day, that there would be some yelling or a switch to our behinds.  While we were free, there was no other world to return to.

Mallory walked back from the bathroom, leaned against the car with me.  “There was a line.  Sorry.”

I shook my head, gestured to the little family on the concrete picnic tables.  “Was thinking that must be nice.  Mom and dad telling you to eat a soggy sandwich, everyone piled in the car to go somewhere not terribly special.”

She leaned forward and looked at them.  “Maybe.  Seems more like it would be crowded and hot and boring in the car, especially if you could be at home eating pizza and playing video games instead.”

I smiled, pushing myself up from the car, unlocking the door.  “Look at their little family.  How cute are they?  You have no romance, no warmth in your soul, Mallory.”

She laughed, walking around the other side, climbing in.  “It’s Ok.  You can manage for both of us, I’m sure.”

It was getting dark before we decided to stop.  We pulled into a motel parking lot, sign advertising free HBO.  I parked the car outside the office and walked in.

“Room for the night.  Double, or a single with a couch, if you’ve got it.”

The guy behind the counter looked up from the TV on the desk.  “Fifty a night for the double.”

I took out my credit card, handed it to him.  He turned back to the TV and managed to run my card and to get me to sign, even gave me the room key without looking back away from the screen.

“Number seventeen.”  He lifted a hand and pointed, still not looking.  “It’s that way, along the front.  You’ll see it.”

“Thanks.  Is someone going to be at this desk tonight if we need anything?”

For that he looked up.  “What’re you gonna need?”

“I don’t know, towels, food delivered, something like that.”

He pulled a flyer off a stack on the counter, handed it to me.  “You order food, just tell ‘em your room number.  They know what to do.”

“Thanks.”

He didn’t answer.

We drove across the empty parking lot, around the crater of a pool with no water, all the chairs and tables stacked up to one side.  I stopped in front of the room, turned off the car and sat still for a moment.

“I’m sure it’ll be… charming,” Mallory began to laugh.

I couldn’t help it and chuckled with her.  “Beggars, and paupers, can’t be choosers.”

She got out and picked up a few of our bags, I grabbed the cooler and set the other bags on top of it.  I pulled them out and locked the car, tossing the room key to Mallory.  She unlocked it and we went inside.  It was warm, the A/C wasn’t on, and everything smelled musty.  I set my load down and clicked on a lamp, tapped at the window unit.  It clattered into life, blowing loud, cold air into the room.  I stood for a moment in front of the roar, the smell of stale moisture coming from it.  It was almost perfect, a kind of freedom, the smells and sounds of rattling old A/C unit, like we were in a place outside the safe and normal every day lines.  A dingy room with an old TV, a door with too many locks, windows that opened onto a mostly empty asphalt parking lot, a bathroom with stiff towels and tiny packaged soaps.  An ice bucket with no liner bags, and no indication where the ice machine would be.  Mallory was smiling, she sat down on one of the beds and fell back.

“Order food.  I’m going to just lay here until something delicious arrives.”

“You’re a huge amount of help, you know that, right?”

She laughed.  “It’s your crazy-kidnapper-lady trip.  You get to handle the accommodations and food preparations.”

I put the flyer of order-in places next to her.  “Find something, I’ll call them.”

She picked the list up lazily and stared at it for a moment, before setting it down again, standing up.  “I’ve changed my mind.  I’m going to brave the shower.  You pick something, I don’t care what we eat.”

I took the list, dialed almost at random, and laid back on the bed, waiting for a knock or my turn to shower.

A knock came and startled me awake.  I hadn’t realized I’d fallen asleep.  I grabbed my wallet and went to the door, bleary eyed, fumbling for some cash.  I pulled open the door, expecting to see a delivery driver standing there.  No one was at the door, a car was just pulling up into a parking space.  I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, looked down the dark little covered alcove, but there were just closed doors to rooms with no lights.  The delivery guy got out, handed me a few plastic bags with styrofoam boxes, I handed him some cash.

“Hey, did you see anyone just now?” I asked him as he took the money, beginning to walk away.

“What, here?”

“Yeah, just before you drove up.  I thought I heard a knock.”

He pulled open his car door, getting in, giving me a strange look.  “No.  And man, I just deliver food.  Don’t involve me in your shit.”  He shut the door and pulled out of the space, driving off.

I walked back inside, set the food down on the little table, pulled the boxes out of the bags.  Mallory came out of the bathroom showered and changed.  “What’d you get for us?”

I opened a box, distantly aware of having ordered some kind of mexican food.  “Fajitas, I think.”  I held up two styrofoam boxes.  “Chicken or beef?”

“Surprise me.”

I handed her a box, we both began to eat.  She turned on the TV, flipped through some channels, ended up settling on a made-for-TV movie, volume turned almost all the way down.  Neither of us really felt like watching.  We ate quietly for a few minutes, until I heard another knock.  I leaned back in my chair and pulled the curtain back from the window.  I didn’t see anyone.  I put my food down and stood up, going over to the door, pulling it open.  No one was there.  I looked up and down the covered concrete strip in front of the apartments, but I couldn’t see anyone.  I looked back at Mallory.  “Did you hear that?”

She looked over at me, tortilla in her hand.  “Hear what?  What are you doing?”

“The knocking at the door, you didn’t hear that?”

She shook her head.  “I didn’t hear anything.  Thought you were just being weird.”

I shut the door and latched it.  “You mind if we turn off the TV for a minute?  I want to see if it happens again.”

“Yeah, sure, whatever.  One second,” she pressed the power button with her little finger, still holding her fajitas.  “Alright, off.  And for your information, this is one of those moments where I warn you about seeming crazy.”

I nodded, putting my finger to my lips.  “Ok.  Hush.”

She shrugged and went back to eating.  I walked to the window and tried to pull the curtains just enough to look out without it being obvious.  A few minutes passed, then more.  A quarter of an hour went by, and I got bored, I sat back down and started eating, still listening though.  Finally it came again, a quick set of knocks.  “There, did you hear that?”

“What, your enforced silence?  Yeah, I heard it.”

“No, the knocking.  Seriously, you didn’t hear it?”

She looked at me.  “You’re beginning to freak me out, Chris.  I didn’t hear anything.”

I went over and pulled the door open, looking around.  There was no one there.  But on the ground there was now a photograph, flipped over.  I picked it up, looked around, but no one was anywhere near.  I closed the door and locked it.

“What’s that?”

I walked over and sat down next to her on the bed.  “A photograph.  It was on the doorstep.”

She looked at it with me.  “It’s just the one you had in your pocket earlier, the one you showed me.  The woman crying.”

I nodded.  “Yeah, it is.  But look at the back.”

She took it and flipped it over.  “‘I cannot bear her loss.’  I’m assuming you’re going to tell me this wasn’t here before?”

I took it, looked at the writing.  “If it was, Mal, I didn’t see it.”

She stood up, put her styrofoam box in the aluminum cylinder of a garbage can, shoving it down so it would fit.  “If you’re trying to creep me out, you can just stop.”

“Seriously Mal, I didn’t do this.  And why would I fuck around with you?  Whatever this is, we’re already driving across the country over it.”

She took the photograph from me and stared at it, the words on the back.  “Why didn’t I hear the knocking?”

I stood up, walking back to the window, looking out it.  “I don’t know.”

She dropped the photograph on the table.  “If you did it, just tell me now.  I won’t be mad, it’s a good joke.  I just want to know.”

I let the curtains fall shut, turning back to her.  “I really didn’t.”
