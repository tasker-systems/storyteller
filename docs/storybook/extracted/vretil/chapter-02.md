I’m sitting on the floor of a cave, covered in dust from the climb.  The sound of moisture from the recess behind me echoes the drip between stalactite and stalagmite, uncounted centuries shaping this alien terrible mouth, forever frozen just before clenching, crushing an ephemeral prey.  I’m holding the last photograph, but I’ve turned off my lamp.  I don’t need to see it to know the figure it shows.

“I know you’re here.”

She doesn’t reply.  I can neither hear nor see her, but it makes little difference.  Even if her heart beat no more, her words silenced, her breath stopped, she would be here.  She has been here since the beginning.  Or at least this beginning.

There are candles lit.  I can see the flicker of fire on the stone, twelve of them spaced about the walls of the cave, ringing me in at a distance too far for their tiny light to illuminate.  I sit here in the center with the dreaming plant, and I know she has waited.  I know she’s been in the dark and with her hand of blood she’s waited for me to come.  We are in a womb, whatever profanity she might bring, and she who’s yet to come is greater than the old woman’s knife, greater than her bloody palm, greater than the darkness crowding around me here.

Steps sound, bare feet in the sand.  I see a darkness pass by a candle, and gone.  She has moved between me and it for that moment, I flash my lamp on, to where her steps should now be.  There is no one there, an empty rock wall, the slash of my light cutting across the red sand.  There are footprints in the light, but no one stepping, and as abruptly as they start, they end.  Toes and heel.  She is right to be bare, here.  Had I the courage I would strip naked; there is not space for anything else.  I back away, toward a candle.  I do not know how long my lamp will last.

I find the wall and press my back against it, and extinguish the flashlight.  I kneel down, resting against the cool stone.  I am in the candle light, and I know that she can see me.  But perhaps she could before.  At my feet there is a pictogram drawn fresh in the dirt, and a photograph lying near it.  The pictogram is of the ball of the sun, and stick figure children playing atop the crude curve of a hill.  In the photograph I stand with my child’s arms raised out to the sun, extended wide as if in greeting.  I begin to shake as I recognize it as the first of them.

“Why?  Why did you put this here?”

She does not answer.  I do not disturb the photo where it lies, nor scratch out the markings in the earth.  I am afraid.

I am afraid for a birth and a death.

I have dreamt my sister in this cave.  She has read terrible words to me, here.  And a goddess woke.

I am as afraid of such waking as I am of the dark and the knife.

I see myself as a boy, walking across the red sand, hand in hand with the old woman in the center of the room.  I look back at myself blankly, my other self at me without recognition.  My flashlight is not on, I do not know how I see them.  The old woman is not looking at me, but him.  She is pointing at the flower, and my younger self does not seem to notice.  He has fixed his gaze on me, and watches.  I feel as if it is demonic, something wrong with the face and eyes, but I cannot determine what.  My tiny hand is in hers and does not struggle.  Finally my younger eyes turn toward the plant, and the child kneels down before it, fixing upon it with the same stare.  Thought finds me and I turn my flashlight on the scene to perhaps more clearly see, but as I do they are both gone.  Only the little plant remains, and it still and without movement, no flight of ghosts so recently near to stir the air.

Beside me there is movement.  My skin crawls from the sound and I shift away but slightly, unwilling to leave the candlelight.  I hear the sound of breath, though my light shows nothing.  This time the sound does not fade.  There is a crevice, a crack in the wall just large enough that a figure might lurk within.  Slowly, trembling, I step out and shine my light, but again there is nothing.  Only the sound of breathing, and the invisible scuffle of feet.

“Who’s there?”

There is no answer.  As before it is only my own voice in echo as response, too loud, unsettling.  The breath has moved and it is behind me, very close.  On my neck.  There is no warmth of life in it, the breath is cold, and I leap with terror from the space, along the wall, scrambling to the next candle.  I have my back to the stone and my flashlight flickering in panic on the place from where my steps have lead.  There are footprints behind my own, but they do not follow me.

“What do you want!?”

And then for the first time there is a voice, as loud as my own.  It is an old voice, of a woman, measured.

“The task is not complete.”

I find for some moments my voice will not come.  I turn the flashlight on again.  The old woman stands naked, fleshed, in the center of the room.  She holds the knife still, her other hand bloody.  Her breasts are old and they hang low, her frame thin, wrinkled.  Her gray hair is loose and flowing about her shoulders, and her eyes are white with cataracts.  She looks at me as if this does not matter.  I have not answered and she speaks again.  “Your task is not complete.”

I find my voice.  “It is not my task.  It never has been.”

“It is.  It cannot be other.”

“I don’t know what more you want me to do!”

She is gone.  There are footprints where she stood, but she is gone.  My lamp’s light cannot find her.  I lean back against the wall, turning the light off, and sit in the pool of candlelight, and I wait.

I wait for long enough that I wonder if she will return at all.  I look down and my steps have scuffed an edge of the symbol in the dirt, and red dust all but covering the photograph.  I pick it up and shake the dust from it.  It is as the rest a picture of me as a child, and I have, like them, seen this one before.  In it, I sit cross-legged, a fire of tissue paper cut out and held above my head by adult hands.  My eyes are open but still, the fire does not touch me.  I am reminded of Christ’s disciples, as they found their tongues awakened.  What is left of the pictogram in the dirt seems to be a lighthouse or a tower.  I cannot tell.

And I remember having asked the fire.  It has shown me all of this once before.  But neither then did it show me what I must do.

The tremble of the earth comes again.  The dust still does not move but there can be no doubt.  I felt it.  She is coming, and I have done nothing to prepare the way.  A birthing chamber, this is only dirt and stone.

From behind me I feel movement, and pressed against the wall as I am, I start from it.  There is a snake working its way through the sand, beneath a crack in the stone I had not seen.  I leap back unnerved, turning my flashlight toward it.  Its head is red, and as it draws its body through, the rest of it is red as well, scales in the candlelight shining, edged with black.  It does not pause to look at me, but slithers to the plant in the center of the room.  The snake is small, and it winds itself up through the leaves and about the stem.  The plant sags beneath the weight, but it does not break or fall.  The serpent moves its head to just beneath the purple-white blossom, and stops, and seems to wait.  Quietly, as I wait.

There is a compulsion to my steps, my feet begin to move.  I follow the beam of my flashlight toward the center of the room.  The little snake turns its head to me, watching my approach, but does not abandon its place.  I kneel near the plant, and I extend my hand.  The snake slides toward me, and coils about my arm.  I am not in control of my motion, my will moved by some other force.  The serpent climbs up my arm and rests, turning its head down toward my palm.  It rests its head there, and the thought of being stung won’t leave my mind but I can do nothing.  It rests on me as if I were too but a still and silent shoot of botany.  I do not rise but stay kneeling.

My flashlight begins to flicker and fade.  In long minutes sitting motionless, a serpent in my hand, the beam grows dim.  Soon it has all but gone out.

And then there are pale feet in the tiny splash of light it casts.  I raise my eyes but can see only the hint of gray hair and the pinprick of light reflected from eyes.  Her voice comes and it is close to me.

“This is the dagger you must wield.  Your hand now lethal and red as my own.  There will be a moment when you must strike.  Do not fail it.  Your weapon will sting you as quick as any other.”

She is gone, and my flashlight has faded.  About my wrist and in my palm there is no more snake, and in its place a knife.  I reach down to feel the blade and it is sharp.  I am alone and it is dark and I hold a weapon of what use I do not know.  The earth trembles and I begin in time to quake with a new and holy terror.  She will come and I am unready.  I sit back into the dirt, and turn such thought as I can summon back toward the beginning, hoping some answer lies behind me.
