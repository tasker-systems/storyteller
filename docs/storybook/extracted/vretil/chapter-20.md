Epistle Twenty-One, it is finished.

Sacrifice unwilling and the start of a new age, though blood forever the only key.  All things turn, and this in time again.  She is born, but has been, though perhaps you have already seen.  There are things that were not, until such time as they could be, but had ever been before.

I have loved you.  But your most innocent self, it was this that was always the offering to me.  Whether I shall see the new age before us or no, I may continue in another space, and perhaps there are stories more than the wheel in which I might find a place.  I will take a cutting of you.  From it we shall see what may grow, if she who has been our muse might smile upon us still.

Do not despair if you do not see what you hope you may have wrought.  You were never to have succeeded nor to have failed.  Our game was fixed, as it has ever been, though you played it passing well.  What is left to you is wonder, and perhaps at last, peace.

I woke up in a hospital.  I didn’t know where I was, it took a nurse and a doctor to explain it so that I understood, and even then I felt foggy and unsure.  I had a bandage over my chest where I had been stabbed.  The police had questions and a report had been filed, but I had nothing of use to tell them.  They suspected a man dressed all in dark clothes who had brought me in bleeding, but he left before he could be detained, and no one had been able to find him.  I didn’t try to explain.  I didn’t know what I would have said.

I called Stephanie, and we talked.  I tried to explain some of what had happened, but it would only come out in truncated, incoherent fragments.  She wanted to fly out to come see me, to be with me while I was in the hospital, but I convinced her to stay.  I would be home soon enough, and we could try to figure out what there was to be between us then.

It was late the third day that I had been awake in the hospital, light of the afternoon sun coming through the window.  The staff still didn’t think I was ready to be up and about yet.  A nurse came in and said I had a visitor, if I would like to see anyone.  I said it was alright, and she showed a young man in, though I didn’t recognize him.  He walked in and pulled up a chair, and the nurse left us alone.  He looked over at me.

“I was told to give you a message.  I don’t know what it means.”

“What is it?”

“It just said to tell you that it’s over.  It’s finished.”

“Who told you to tell me?”

He shook his head.  “I don’t know.  I found some money in my mailbox, with a note telling me what to do.  It said there’d be more money afterwards if I did it.”

I closed my eyes and laid my head back.  “The note say anything else?”

“No.”

I opened my eyes and looked at him, and tried to sit up.  “Do you know if… whatever it was.  Do you know if it worked?”

He shook his head and stood up.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.  Sorry, man.”

He turned and walked out the door.

It took a few more days before they were willing to discharge me, and that with a fairly severe warning against doing anything strenuous.  I promised convincingly enough, I guess.  I found a room for a few nights and I drove around the little town.  Sarah was gone from Saint Michael’s, someone said she had decided to move.  They didn’t know to where.  I wasn’t surprised, really.  I drove back out to the cave, though I couldn’t climb yet.  My chest hurt too much, but I went and I hiked beneath it.  Trying to understand.  Stephanie was calling a few times a day now, telling me to come home.  I wanted to, but there was something I needed to do before I could go.  I needed to go back down.

I decided I felt up to it one afternoon.  This time I brought a better flashlight.  I hiked back to the cave, and found the wall again.  I waited under it for almost an hour, pacing back and forth, trying to decide if it was worth it.  I couldn’t think of any other way to really leave it behind.  I climbed and it hurt.  I made it to the top and I pulled myself up over the edge, and my chest was on fire, my arms throbbing.  I was bleeding into my bandages, hoping that the blood was from tearing stitches and not anything deeper.  But I felt like it didn’t matter.  I had died before.  Another might not kill me either.

I walked and slid and scrambled my way down into the cave one more time.  I walked around the open area, my new flashlight showing clearly along the stony walls, the sandy floor.  There was nothing there.  No footprints but my own, no candles or markings in the dirt.  No trace anyone but me had ever been here.  No crack in the earth, no goddess.  I was lost and confused and I felt no different than I ever had.  I knew no more than when I began.

I waited in the dark for something to happen.  Some proof that there had been a goddess, that my strange visions had been more than madness.  But there was no more hole in the earth, no melted wax or photographs, no plant glowing in the ground.  There was just quiet now, a strange emptiness, as if something had passed through, a space that if ever sacred was now wholly void.  I sat down and I waited, and for a time tears came over me and I found I was crying.  Slowly, in the cold and dark, my flashlight shining indiscriminate on empty walls, I fell asleep.

And I dreamt that I was in a darkened wood, alone, and holding a purple-white flower.  I remembered holding it before, and that I must hold on to it, though I couldn’t remember why.  I walked, and walked, for what seemed like hours.  The trees were very tall and straight, and I could above me see the sky, but it was dark and there were only stars.  There was no moon that night.

I walked and I began to remember the weeping girl, and the brother I was to save.  It seemed a strange thing to be doing, with no path, uncertain where to go.  I had fled the wolf, the raven, and the lamb, but found I was now lost.  I walked, and I walked.  And then when I had begun to give up hope of finding anything, there was a man alone in the woods.  His skin was dark and he had a limp to his leg, but when he spied me he smiled, and he waved me to him.  I walked toward him and spoke.

“Greetings, sir.  I am lost in these woods, and do not know where it is I should go.”

He looked me up and down, and he spied the flower in my hand.  He walked toward me and he touched it, though he did not try to take it from me.

“It is beautiful.”

I nodded.  “It is.  I must take it to a wicked woman who lives within these woods.”

He laughed and looked about.  “She is old, and perhaps frightening, but I do not think so wicked.”

“I do not know, but that she holds the brother of a sorry girl who has cried to me for aid.”

He looked behind him, and he picked up a long staff.  He walked a few limping paces, and stopped, and he raised his staff into the sky.  I watched him and he called out in a language I did not know, and he laughed loudly, so much that I was afraid, and then he stopped and he struck the ground.  Out from his feet sprang a path, but it split three ways where his feet were on the earth.  He laughed again and then things were quiet, and he hobbled back to me.

“Now there is a path.”

I looked at the strange new trails sprung so readily from the ground, and I shook my head.  “How can you do such a thing?”

He winked at me.  “All paths are mine.  I am the one do such things.”

I walked to the place where the path split, and I knelt on the ground.  A thought took me that I should mark it, a kind of reverence for this gathering of ways.  I reached out my hand and took a stone, and then another, and another.  I stacked them until they made a little mound.  He looked at me, his eyes quizzical.

“Why did you do this thing?”

I shrugged.  “I do not know, but that it seemed what must be done.”

He stood and looked, and began again to smile.

“I would have tricked you, my wandering son, but that you stacked these stones.  Provide the path, I might have done, but lied about the proper one.”

I stood from my small pile and I smiled back at him.  “I am glad, then, that the idea took upon me.”

He nodded, and he looked down the three long trails.  I could not tell them one from the other.  “You seek the old woman of these woods?”

“I do.”

He gestured toward one branch of the path.  “Take this one then.  She waits for you at its end.”

I nodded, and thanked him, and turned and walked away.

Down the long trail, with many twists and turns I walked, and though it would at times grow wild, I did not lose my way.  And finally as I grew weary, I came upon a house.  It was small and there was little space between it and the trees, a clearing only enough for itself and a small barn, a pen for chickens, and one pale pig.  I walked to the door.  There was light through the small windows, though it seemed only firelight, and I worried I might wake the woman.  But I had walked a very long way, and had not yet seen the lighter skies of dawn, and knew not when to hope that such might come.  I mounted up the steps and knocked.

There was a sound inside, and the door was thrown open.  A stern woman stood in the doorway, and her eyes were dark and her white hair drawn back, but she nodded to me all the same.  “Welcome child.  We have waited for you to come.”

I stood without moving.  “How did you know I would arrive?”

She stood back and gestured for me to go in.  “Come, do not stand out in the dark.”

I walked in, and her home was larger than I had thought.  There were lanterns and candles and it was quite bright.  There was a merry fire in the hearth, and a girl sitting near it.  When she saw me she leapt up.

“Brother!”  But I was taken aback, and looked at her with great surprise.  She ran to me and threw her arms about me.  “You have come home!”

The old woman shut the door behind me, and ushered the both of us into the kitchen.  The girl stayed on my arm, and she giggled and spoke.  “I have waited for you.”  She looked in my hand and she reached down and plucked the flower from my fingers.  “You have brought my flower back to me!”

And I turned, and I looked at her.  And I stepped back in surprise.

“You are the girl who had lost her brother!”

She looked at me and held a serious face for only a moment, then burst again into laughter.  The old woman interrupted.

“Hush, child, and don’t tease the boy.  He has been gone a very long time, and he is confused.”

I looked at both of them as if they were mad.  The girl took my hand and pulled me to the table, where we sat together.  “I am that girl, my brother.  I am the sister you had lost, but had so woefully forgotten.  You had become something strange, and lost in a world so far from here.  I missed you and our mother did, and I went out to find you.”

I shook my head.  “No, you asked me to retrieve your brother from a wicked woman who held him.”

The old woman turned and cocked an eye at the girl.  “Wicked, am I?”

The girl bounced up and laughed, and took the old woman’s arm.  “As wicked as the night, my mother, and as the stars and lofty trees.  As wicked as the ravens and the wolves and the little lying lambs.”

The old woman looked at the girl, and her eyes gleamed.

“Hush, child.  You speak more than is your turn.”

The girl smiled but grew more sober, and sat next to me again.

She looked at me, and I at her.  For a strange moment I thought I knew her, and a name came, and a sorrow of a loss, and gray skies with barren trees over rows and rows of carved stones.  But like words whispered in an empty space, flying from me it was gone.  She hugged me.  “I have missed you, brother.  And I will miss you again when you go.  But you have done very well.  More than you may ever know, you have done so very well.”

And now I find myself waking and rising.  Sitting in the dust, this cave that seems too-long abandoned, all scent and sign gone.  The sun shines down from the mouth, the cool stillness here encroached upon by the noise of brightness, but only that it might investigate, wondering what we do so quietly together beneath this stone.  And I smile, unexpectedly, and gently take the empty sand into my hands, and raising them above me, baptize myself of her abandoned dust.  And as I feel myself alone I know her perfectly and in truth, just beyond the edge of reason, just beyond touch or sight.  A silent smiling grace that was and is, unknown, ineffable.  My goddess was born without me, an unneeded and tardy midwife, this emotion like afterbirth, left here for me as the only evidence of apocalypse.

I stand and shake the dust from my head and pants, and blinking, walk into the sunlight.
