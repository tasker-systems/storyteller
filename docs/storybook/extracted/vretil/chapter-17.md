Epistle Nine, the way is made ready.

All has been prepared, and we wait now only for your unguided step to find.

There is a serpent, and an egg, and a goddess at the beginning of the world.  And there is a hidden one among them, the world beginning this time and again, and again.  Genesis is ever multitude, only forgotten.  But it is that hidden one I cannot see, and the woeful space of blindness for which I can find no answer.  I cannot tell if it is her cruelty or love that hides this from my eyes, that I must send you so untried, alone and full of folly, into such a place.

And while I cannot help but fear, you are not stranger to what will come.  And whatever my hateful countenance may show, and however soon I may no more be, I am there, with you.

-----

It was a long conversation, and the hours that passed only made it more surreal.  In the empty expanse of desert along an under-maintained county road, there was a cave.  Sarah said I was to climb down into it.  I argued, saying it was madness to expect me to go into a cave alone.  That I didn’t have any equipment or experience, that I didn’t know anything about ropes or lights or helmets.  She laughed and consoled me, but didn’t relent.  She said I was supposed to go down into this cave, though she didn’t know when or why, or if she did, she wouldn’t say.  I argued more but it was futile, she wasn’t even trying to argue back, only smiling when I would protest.  A cave in the desert, on my own.  It was an unhidden snare, placed unabashedly in plain view.  I would suspect the trap itself of being a decoy, some more terrible strategy still lingering unseen behind, but that I was becoming blind, more and more unable to see what was before me, save by single steps, and even those taken haltingly and confused.

Sarah drew me a map and gave me directions.  It didn’t seem to matter when I was to go.  She said I should go as soon as I could, though that I might wait until I was more composed.  I was on edge, uncertain now to a point that I didn’t know what I should believe.  Every piece of it was implausible, much of it impossible.  And yet it was those things that were closest to impossible which I could least refute, not even knowing where to begin.  As if concealing curtains, pulled away, revealed only a further chamber, filled with unnamable things.

We talked until the sun began to go down, and she said she had errands she needed to take care of before it got much later.  By then I had more or less run out of questions, if not from an abundance of answers.  I went out for dinner, but I thought more than I ate.  When I was done I drove back toward the campsite, but halfway there I changed my mind.  I knew where I was supposed to go now, and there could only be a few nights more of this at most.  I was too unsettled to sleep alone in the cold of a tent - I wanted to be able to turn on the heater in the room, to call Stephanie.  I wanted to put on the television, to have human voices talk about normal things, a studio audience laughing at jokes being oversold.  To have a incandescent bulb throw warm light into a room, one where I could see all the corners, to lie still on a bed and try not to think of anything until I fell asleep.

I had gotten a room and taken a shower.  I pulled out the map Sarah drew for me and compared it to the one Mallory had put together.  Or that I had put together as Mallory.  I wasn’t sure how to keep that straight right now.  I compared the maps, but Mallory’s wasn’t detailed enough to show the road.  I took out the state by state map we’d bought, flipped it open to New Mexico and and found it there.  The road didn’t seem to go anywhere.  Probably a few trailers, maybe an industrial complex or something like it at the end, unsightly and being kept at a distance.

I turned on the TV and laid down on the bed, flipping through the channels.  Staring through them, scarcely seeing what was there one from the next.  I wanted to call Stephanie.  I wanted to talk to someone, to tell what had happened to me today, to try to, by putting into words, understand it myself.  But none of it made enough sense for me to know what I would say.  Photographs more strange than even those in the box, so many that it was impossible that I wouldn’t remember.  To say nothing of the old woman and my youngest self again in the photographs, after the blank space between.  And what would I say of Sarah, this nun who had known for years that I would come, and had long waited to show me where to go next?  There was nothing left cohering any of it together with any kind of reason, only extensions of an impossibility to which I had already found myself bound.

But I decided I wanted to hear her voice, even if I said nothing of any of this.  I turned the television down low, and picked up my cell phone and called Stephanie.

“Hey, it’s me.  Do you have a minute?”

“Yeah.  Is everything Ok?”

“Yeah.  I just wanted to hear your voice.”  I hesitated.  In my hesitation the pull of normalcy of daily conversation took me, and I let it.  “How was your day?”

“It was fine.  Little scuffle between two patients during art therapy, but it got broken up pretty quickly.”

“You Ok?”

“Oh, yeah, I was across the room.  Some orderlies broke it up before it got out of hand.”

“That’s good.”

“Just think, that could be your job soon.”

She laughed, and I did.  Stephanie waited, then asked gently, “Is everything really Ok?”

“I don’t know.  I think so.  I’m alright, I just miss you.”

“I miss you, too.”  Neither of us spoke for a moment.  Finally she asked “So, where are you?  I’m guessing you made it to New Mexico?”

“I did.  I’m a little south of Albuquerque.”

“How was the drive?”

“Wet and cold most of the way.  Less wet here, but still cold.  I got a hotel room instead of camping tonight.”

“Good.  I worried about you camping alone out there.”  She paused, and spoke more softly.  “When do you think you might be coming home?”

“Soon.  A few days I hope.”

“Does that mean you… I don’t know.  Found something?”

“Maybe.  I’m not sure yet.  Either way I’m not staying more than a few days longer.  If it doesn’t work out soon, I don’t know if it will.”

She took a breath, I could hear it through the phone.  “I miss you, Chris.  More than I expected to.”

“I miss you, too.”  I paused.  “I’m sorry.  I’m sorry for leaving.”

She didn’t answer.  Finally she said, “I should go.  I’m tired, I’ve got to go in early tomorrow.”

“Ok.”

She was quiet on the other end of the line, but she didn’t hang up.  There was a sound and she spoke again.  “Hold on, someone’s at the door.”

“Right now?”

“Yeah.  They just knocked.  I’m going to go check it.”

She set the phone down, I could hear it make a sound as it rocked.  I didn’t hear anything for a moment, but I waited.  A few seconds later she came back, her voice a little tight.  I sat up.

“That’s weird.  There was no one there.”

“You sure it was knocking?  Not just the wind, a car door slamming or something?”

“No, it was knocking.”

“That’s strange.  Are you Ok?”

“Yeah, I’m fine.  Probably some kids or something.”  She didn’t say anything for a minute, then spoke again, her voice shaking.  “Shit.”

“What?”

“Someone’s knocking again.  It’s loud this time.”

I could hear the sound of the phone change.  She must have held it out, because I heard a distinct knocking sound as well.  I heard her breath come back to the receiver.  “Did you hear that?”

“I did.  Steph, don’t open the door.  Maybe you should call the police.”

She didn’t say anything for a moment.  Her voice was upset when she did.  “I’m going to go check the door.  I’m bringing the phone with me.  Just keep talking to me.”

“Stephanie, this is a bad idea.  Just make sure it’s locked, and call the police.  Two sets of knocks like that, especially if no one was there the first time, means someone’s fucking with you.  Better to be a little paranoid than have something bad happen.”

“The locks are set.  Hold on.”  It sounded like she took the phone away from her face again.  When I heard her next, it was a muffled “Oh my god.”

“Stephanie?  What’s going on?”  She didn’t say anything.  I didn’t know if she had the phone to her ear or not, I didn’t know if she could hear me.  “Stephanie!”  I stood up from where I’d been sitting and started pacing back and forth.

A few moments later she spoke into the phone, her voice a hushed whisper.  “It’s that woman.  She’s here, at my door, Chris.”

“What?  What woman?”

“The one from your fucking pictures!  She’s looks exactly the same.  She’s standing there staring at me through the door like she can see me!”

I didn’t know what to do.  I swore under my breath.  “It can’t be her.  She would be older now.”

“I don’t care, Chris!  I don’t care if it’s her or a goddamn body double, someone’s knocking at my front door, and it looks like the same woman who you’re out there looking for right now!”

“Shit.”  I tried to think of something, but only one thought came to mind.  I spoke as calmly and evenly as I could.  “Ok, look.  You’re going to have to do something for me.  Put me on speaker and hold the phone up to the door.”

“What?”

“Just… let me talk to her.  Let me tell whoever it is that I’m here.  That I’m doing what they fucking want.”

Her breath was coming quickly.  I heard her click the button for speakerphone, the sound of the call changed.  She was quiet for a minute, but there was a rustling to the phone and after a moment she whispered.  “I’m going to hold the phone up to the door, but I’m not opening it, not even with the chain.  You’re going to have to yell.”  There was another rustling, and I could hear her speak, though now from farther away.

“Whoever you are… I have Chris on the phone.  Just listen to him, Ok?  He’s going to say something.”

I waited until the phone sounded like it was still.  I spoke loudly into the receiver.

“I’m here, in New Mexico.  I’m doing what you want.  I’ve spoken to Sarah, and I know where the cave is, Ok?  I know where I’m going.  You’ve already won.  Just leave her alone, do you hear me?  She has nothing more to do with this.”

There was no reply.  Everything was very still.  I waited, I didn’t know what else to say, or what more I could do from the end of a phone line.  There was noise from the phone again, as if it was being moved, and after a few moments Stephanie came back on the line, clicking it off of speaker.

“I think she’s gone.  I can’t see her anymore.”

“Jesus.  Are you Ok?”

She laughed, a high, nervous, trembling sound.  “No.  Not at all.”

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s not your fault.”

Neither of us spoke, quiet and shaken.  Finally she asked, “That couldn’t have been her, could it?  Like you said, she would be much older now.”

“Yeah, no.  It couldn’t have been.  Had to be someone dressed and made up to look like her.  How clearly could you see?”

“Through the spy hole, I could see her pretty clearly.  It really, really looked like her.”  She was quiet for a moment.  “Mostly, it was in the eyes.  The way she stared was the way she seemed to pierce through the photographs you showed me.”

My voice was quiet, hushed with apology.  “I’m sorry.  I wish I’d been there.”

“Me too.”

I didn’t speak, and neither did she for a few minutes.  When she did, her voice was more even, but quiet.  “It’s probably good you’re there.  I guess… I don’t know.  You may have been right.  There may not have been another way.”

I paused for a moment, took a deep breath.  “Stephanie, there were… things that I saw, today.  I don’t know what I’m going to do yet.  Honestly, I’m having trouble telling what’s real.”

“What did you see?”

I didn’t answer immediately, thinking, unable to find a way to begin that wouldn’t frighten her further.  “I’ll tell you when I get back.  It’s too hard to describe.“  I sighed, putting my head in my hand.  “To be honest, If I think about it too much, I don’t know if I’ll be able to go through with all of it.  Some of it… has really scared me.”

“Chris… be careful.”

“Yeah.”

We talked for a while longer.  We tried to change the subject away from what had just happened, trying to get back to normal as much as possible.  She was jumpy and nervous, which made sense.  I couldn’t understand why they’d needed to send someone to her house.  I was already doing what they wanted.  She put on some music, sat and talked to me, mostly about nothing.  Words spun around one another as reassurance and comfort more than for any particular content.  Eventually she sounded sleepy, and calm enough to rest.  She let me go, and I sat on the edge of the bed, holding the phone in my hands, not knowing what more to do.

I sat there for long enough to get tired.  I decided to try to sleep, turning off the lamps and pulling the blankets over me.  I lay there quietly, trying to let my mind slow rather than spin, but it wouldn’t.  At some point, unaware, I drifted off into what must have been a very light sleep.  I was woken up more by a strange quiet than by a sound.  The heater had turned off, the room was getting cold.  Groggily I stood up, blanket wrapped around me, and walked over to the heater and turned it back on, and turned it up.  I stood in front of it for a few minutes as it rattled, trying to get warm.  Seemed like a wasted effort and I went to lay back down.

I fell asleep again, or close to it, drifting in and out.  I heard the heater click off, and it woke me up.  It was freezing still.  I stumbled back out of bed and turned it back on, and fell back down on the mattress, the blankets still wrapped around me.  There was the sound of water running from the bathroom, but faint, probably the pipes to someone else’s room making noise in the walls.

I couldn’t fall back asleep.  I rolled over, trying to get warmer and more comfortable.  As I did, from the corner of my eye I thought I saw a flicker of movement.  I thought it must have been a blur from a tired eye, but I sat up a little to take a look.  There wasn’t anything there.  I shook my head at my own jumpiness, rolled over on to my side.  I lay there, my eyes half-closed, out of focus.  I thought I saw something moving in the reflection from the TV screen, and I turned my head to look, but again nothing was there.  I rolled over again, my eyes trying to close, my thoughts still coming too loudly, but with less coherence and purpose now.  I began to nod off for real, thinking I was glad of weariness overtaking me at last.

And then there was a voice.  “You do not have the luxury of rest.  She is waiting.”

I started up, my eyes scanning the room.  There, in the corner, was the old woman, naked and staring.  Not glowing, no strange ephemeral luminescence.  As real as the chair she was standing in front of.  Arms down at her sides, her gray hair in her face.

She spoke again.  “You must make haste.  There is no more time.”

I shouted in alarm and reached beside me to flip on the lamp on the nightstand, more on reflex than thought.  I spun back toward the corner, but she wasn’t there.  I leapt out of bed and looked around the room, checking in the bathroom and the small sliding-door closet.  She wasn’t anywhere I could see.  I went to look where she’d been standing, and there were two footprints of red dust, and to one side were a few bright red spots, as if blood had dripped down and stained.  I shuddered and sat back on the floor in front of them, leaning against the bed for a while, just staring.

I didn’t try to sleep again.  It was just past three in the morning, I gathered my things, packed them, and went to the front desk to check out.  I was going to the cave, unwilling to wait any longer.  I got in my car and started to drive, but it was dark and I didn’t know the roads.  I almost missed the turn, the sign was old and worn, and there were clouds covering the moon.  It was dark, my headlights seeming insufficient to pierce it.  I turned down the road, driving slowly, the asphalt cracked and broken, as much a dirt road as paved.  Boulders mounded up to the sides, overlarge and imposing.  The ground was higher to my left, a hill that seemed to follow the road all the way down.  I drove slowly and looked off to the side.

Sarah had said the cave was in the hillside, but back away from the road, though whether a quarter mile or ten she wasn’t certain.  She had only been there once, many years ago, and never down inside.  She said there was a small driveway that opened off to the left of the road, and that it went down about twenty yards, leading to some trails used by hikers and mountain bikers.  I drove until I found it and turned in, pulled up as far as I could.  There was no one else around.  I switched the car off and got out, pulling out my flashlight.  It was cold, there was only a little bit of wind, but it was coming down from the hill, not being blocked by it.  I shivered and turned my flashlight on, locked the car and walked toward the side of the hill.  There were a few wooden steps to mark the opening of the trail, though they only continued for a few yards up the hill before abandoning it to dirt and rock.  There was a small chain across the short guard rail, a sign hung on it that said Do Not Enter.  I stepped over it and walked up the few steps, and started climbing the hill.

I didn’t know where I should be looking.  It was dark and I’d never been here before, and though there wasn’t enough brush to obscure, every crack and crevice looked like it could be a cave.  Sarah had said I shouldn’t have to wander too far from the trail to find it.  Knowing that didn’t help much, from anywhere I stopped there were dozens of places I could see that might have had a cave within a few yards.  But I walked and I looked, shining my flashlight along stones and cracks and dark places on the ground.  I went slowly, the cold biting into me, my pace not quick enough to keep me warm.  The short twisted trees and dry grasses rustled and shook in the wind, and half the time I’d look down I would swear I saw a bare footprint, but when I’d flash the light down toward it, there was nothing there.  My eyes were blurry with weariness and the cold.  But I was here and I wasn’t turning back now.

I began to have the uncomfortable feeling that this was familiar.  If not the individual rocks and stones, then the strange sense of clambering among this landscape in the dark, the only light that of something flashed against the rocks, my body shaking with cold.  Following the ghost of an old woman.  Like I’d done this before, or dreamed it, or had somehow always been doing this, just having forgotten, lost in a thought that had seemed like living some other life.  The dark stones and the wind and my weariness conspired against me and I began to think strange thoughts, to see things in the shadows that weren’t there when I’d shine the light.  For a time I thought I saw Isabella walking among the stones to my right, then Henri off to my left.  I saw a little girl carried by a tall man dressed in dark clothes, and he was ahead of me for a while, looking back at me in worried glances.  I would blink and he would be gone, but he would come back again after some time had passed.  I heard Stephanie’s voice behind me once, and I turned around, but there were only bushes shaking in the wind.

I thought I saw a boy, like me climbing among the rocks.  More than my other ghosts he seemed real, and I tried to call after him.  He didn’t hear me, or didn’t turn to answer.  His steps kept mostly to the path, though from time to time he would walk from it, and seem to stop, looking up and down the trail, gauging the shape or size of a hill.  For my height and stride I couldn’t catch him.  He would turn back to where I followed behind, as if perhaps he heard my voice or steps, but he did not meet my eyes, or seem to recognize my pace behind him.  I followed him at first only that it was the same path, but I worried for the boy, thinking it was too dark and cold for a child with no light to find his way.  But his pace was as good as mine or better, and he seemed more certain of his steps.  I forgot to look to the sides, forgetting to try to find the cave, but followed after, wondering where his steps would take him out so far.

I came upon a small break in the trail that Sarah hadn’t said anything about.  The main path seemed to go off to the right, but a small side one went to the left, and down.  I walked toward the fork and stopped, looking as far down each branch as I could.  I looked for the boy, and he seemed to have gone down to the left.  I wanted to go right, it seemed there was more of the trail, and a wider path that way.  But his steps went left, though more slowly now, and I thought perhaps I could catch him, and see if he was lost or needed help.  I walked down, and the grade was steep.  The rocks slipped beneath my feet and I had to grab on to some of the boulders to the side for support, my flashlight slashing wildly across the path in front of me as I struggled for balance.  As I scrambled it flashed above me, and I happened to look up.  There above where I stood, up an almost vertical climb, was a cave mouth big enough to walk into.

I looked about for the boy, but he was gone.  I continued down the trail, but couldn’t find him.  There were no footprints in the sand.  I went back out to the main path, but he was not there either.  I turned and walked back to the wall, and looked up it to the cave.  I saw the boy standing there at the top, though I hadn’t seen him climb.  I called up to him, but he didn’t look down toward me.  And then he was gone.  I blinked my eyes to clear them, but he was no longer there.  Like the others with me on the path, he had vanished.  I shook myself, and tried not to think of what it meant.  Whatever the cause, I had found my cave.

I climbed, nearly falling more than once.  The wind would catch me and push at me like it wanted to throw me down.  My hands were too cold to feel anything, holding on more by force of will and desperation than strength.  My feet slipped, my shoes too bulky for this kind of climbing.  I couldn’t see in the dark, trying to remember where I had seen each next hold while on the ground, but lost all sense of space and context once I was moving.  I reached out with my hands as high and far as I could, hoping to find the next place to grab, my toes stretching inside my shoes to try to find the next spot to place my foot.  As I ascended my focus narrowed.  I began to forget why I was climbing, only to find the next stone to hold, trying not to shiver so hard as to lose my footing or my grip.

I reached the top and pulled myself over the edge, gasping for breath.  I lay there unmoving for some minutes, the cold slicing through me, but unable to stand.  My hands and arms were stiff and frozen.  Though it wasn’t a problem I had to face now, I didn’t know if I would be able to climb back down.  I rolled to my side and pushed myself up, standing slowly.  I glanced at my scraped and frozen hands, and took the flashlight and pointed it into the mouth of the cave.  There were markings, glyphs of crosses and circles and spirals, things that looked old in design if not creation.  I steeled myself and closed my eyes, taking a long deep breath.  I had come this far.  There was nowhere else to go now but down, and in.

Climbing down into the earth, surrounded by the dark.  The rocks were hard to hold on to and my shoes wouldn’t keep any traction.  I was sliding down dangerously, my grip and the control of my descent lost as often as gained.  It was cold and dark and my flashlight was dim, my arms and hands were cramping and sore from the climb.  It was everything I could do to hold on enough not to begin to stumble and fall uncontrollably down.  Whatever might wait for me below, my more immediate fear was slipping and hitting my head, knocking myself unconscious or worse.  The thought wouldn’t stop plaguing me that if I couldn’t hold traction on my way down, I didn’t know how I would ever get back out.

The gradient began to level out.  Eventually I was falling less and walking more, until what was a narrow entrance seemed to become a wide and sandy floor.  I shone my flashlight up above me but my light was weak, and didn’t illuminate much, just the tips of stalactites but not the heights to which they receded in the ceiling.  I walked a few more steps, and noticed the walls to the side of me began to spread out, each their own direction.  Walking a bit more and soon I was in the middle of an empty and open space, no walls within clear reach of my flashlight.  I looked about me but there was only red dust, and I decided I wasn’t going to walk any farther.  I had gone far enough.  I looked up to the ceiling, and out into the dark, and I raised my voice.

“Alright.  I’m here.  I’ve done what you wanted.”

I waited, but there was no response.  I looked around, walking in a short circle, hoping or expecting to hear some sound, but there was nothing.  No answer made my own voice more bold.  “What do you want?  I climbed down into this fucking cave in the middle of the night!  If you’re going to do something, do it!”

There was still no sound, no answer but my own voice in echo.  I began to let weariness and fear turn into anger.  Uncontested I found my courage, and I yelled into the dark.  “Come on then!  You’ve messed with my life long enough.  You wanted me, I’m here.  Get on with it!”

I began to warm, the trembling anger still ready to break back into fear, but for the moments of shouting I felt stronger.  More brave.  I took a few steps then turned around.

The old woman was there behind me.  She looked at me through the whites of cataracts, and she did not smile, but reached out her hand and grabbed my wrist.  She held me fast and I felt the bones begin to rub.

“Prepare yourself.”

My heart jumped in my chest, my pulse hitting so hard I could scarcely hear.  I screamed and jerked my arm away from her, twisting, turning to run.  My legs seemed to fail and I fell forward.  My face impacted hard into the dirt, and I saw everything go black.
