Two children, a brother and a sister, lay asleep in the woods.  Alone but for the other, her arm about his shoulder, older by a year and protecting him, comforting to sleep, sharing a single blanket between them.  And they, on that night, also shared a dream.  A troubled one of places far away, of peoples strange and unknown, of statues and shrines to quite different gods than their own.  And there was a man then that saw them as they dreamt that they walked beneath strange parapets and through the billowing scent of incense.  He was dreaming too, but aware that it was so.  He saw them pass stalls offering sales of trinkets, pretty baubles that caught with their sparkle the children’s eyes, and he watched as they would stop to wonder at some strange manner of dress of a shopper passing by, or listen with intent ears to curious words they did not recognize.

He saw them enter a shop with a tiny piece of antler on the latch, which fell off as they opened the door.  The man drew back, suspecting an omen, though they unblinking passed it by.  The children as they dreamt went into the store, but he knew it was not a place for children, waking or sleeping.  He could not follow them, and stood on the corner to wait.

A woman, who seemed at first pleasant but changed the more one looked at her into someone more unsettling, walked in front room of the shop from behind a black curtain.  She was tall even for an adult, and she stood much, much taller than the children.  There were shining things of dark glass, beautiful but cold and frightening, on the shelves and situated for display.  There was, on a very low shelf, right where the children could most easily see, a set of sculptures of a lamenting madonna, her black dress swirled about a broken son.  But the faces of the madonnas were strange and unkind, a hard and violent look to the eyes and mouth.  Where there should have been pity or loss there was malice and strife.

“She is beautiful, isn’t she child?” the woman said to the little girl.  The girl looked up at her, and there was a smile on the woman’s face, but the little girl did not trust her.  She leaned stiffly down, reaching to touch the child’s hair.  “Like you, little one.  Beautiful.  Would you like to have one?”  The little girl shook her head no, but she looked at the nearest one anyway, as the woman pointed.  “How about that one?”

The little girl, sleeping and dreaming, looked down at it.  There were other shapes moving in the depths of the madonna’s dark gown, blue-gray things that seemed at first like shadowed reflections of light, but seemed to come from the glass.  She could not help herself now, and looked more closely, the shapes seemed to come to the surface, moving closer to her.  The madonna’s face seemed almost to soften, to smile, as if it matched the woman’s now, without hate but not without threat.  With the unreasoning gesture of dream, the little girl reached out to it, and touched the surface.

The swirling stopped, and for a moment there was just quiet.  Another customer entered the store, and the woman took a final look at the little girl, smiled again, and turned to help the new arrival.  The little boy tapped his sister’s shoulder, and she looked at him surprised, but they rose and left the shop together.  The man who had waited saw them exit, and he watched them as they began to walk.  The girl was paler than before, he noted, and as he followed them, her steps grew slower and more erratic.  Every block she seemed weaker until finally she fell, and could not stand as her brother tried to pull her up.  The man rushed to her side and lifted her gently from the dust of the street.

“Your sister has been hurt,” the man said to the boy, but the boy was too surprised to answer.  “Do you know what happened?”

The little boy shook his head.  The man looked about, up and down the street, and seemed to make up his mind.  “I’m sorry child.  I must take her away to a place where she can heal.”  The boy, mind weary and muddled with dreaming so long, nodded yes.  But the man started off too fast and was lost suddenly in the crowd.  The little boy ran after them, but his feet were too slow, his legs heavy, and suddenly he was cold.  Blinking his eyes, he woke up.

He sat up from the blanket, and the sun broke over the horizon, dawn beaming down on his face.  He stretched, his arms wide to the sunlight, and looked to his side, to wake his sister to tell her of his dream.

But she was gone.  She was not behind him, her shoes stood empty beside his on the grass.  The birds began to call to one another in earnest, the stillness of the early morning broken.  The sun was bright and warm and unconcerned as he began to feel alarmed, casting about desperately, looking behind the nearby trees and calling out her name.  He called for her again and again, running here and there through the trees.  He put on his shoes and picked up hers, tucking them in the slim blanket they had shared, like a pack threw it over his shoulder, and ran back the way they had come the day before, shouting out for her.  When he saw no tracks and thought she could not have come so far, he doubled back again and ran down the trail the direction they had gone the day before.  He called for her and looked frantically about him, hoping for any sight of a bit of fabric or a footprint that might tell him where she’d gone.  She did not answer.  He saw nothing.  She was not there, and nowhere to be found.

He collapsed and wept.  He dropped the blanket and her shoes and he cried.  Children alone they had been, but he was now child only, and he was frightened, sad, and confused.  Where could she have gone?  Why would she go without him?  “Dreams don’t take people, not like that,” the boy said to himself firmly, though he cried while he said it.  “She wouldn’t leave me,” he said out loud.  But inside and afraid he thought, “Would she?”

And so he sat on a stone in what was almost the noonday sun, and with tears on his face he thought.  He thought about trees and birds and squirrels and snakes and where they go when they’re afraid, when they were lost.  But he wondered if squirrels and birds and snakes could be lost, since they already lived in the woods.  He thought of where she had gone before when she would be afraid, but they were much too far away from home for her to hide in any of those places.  He thought about rocks and grass and wildflowers too, because even when one is very serious, it’s often hard not to think at least a little about what you see in front of you.  He thought and thought until the sun now no longer beaming but bearing down made him thirsty, and he stood up from his rock, and walked back down the path toward the creek they had seen and stopped at in the late afternoon the day before.  As he walked, he made up his mind.  He would go in search of his sister, and find her, no matter what.

Just as dreams do not take people in the night, so too do streams not speak.  He was only a boy, but he knew this to be the case.  Water moving over rocks and splashing around roots near the bank might sound like voices to sillier people than himself, but he knew perfectly well that if water did talk, it was certainly not to people.  And more certainly than that, not to someone like him.  Which is why he found it doubly surprising to hear the splashing, slippery sound of it begin, slowly and rhythmically, to say “sister” over and over.

“But that’s what I would want to hear it say, isn’t it?” said the boy, quite reasonably, to himself.  He picked up his pace a bit, but not, he was sure, to go see what the stream had to say.  The sun was hot, and he was thirsty.

“Sister,” he heard again, and was near enough now that he broke into a trot to see what was making the sound.  He pushed past a bush and was at the bank.  He looked up and down the bank, and saw a limb of a tree leaning low over the water.  When the breeze would blow it would bend into the water gently, and when it would slow the limb would raise.  Watching it happen now, he could no longer hear the word being spoken.  He stopped and watched, and wished that, for a moment, he had been wrong about creeks and streams.

He bent down to get a drink, and sat in the shade, thinking.  He thought that the next thing he should do would be to head back to the trail in the woods, and continue down it.  There was to be a village that direction soon enough, they had been there with their mother and father once before.  There would be a town with food and shelter and people, and he was beginning to be hungry.  He picked up a stone and threw it into the water, then another.  He looked down to pick up a third, but as he looked up to throw it there was a man just rounding the bend on a little boat, paddling downstream.  The man saw the boy and waved, and the boy waved in return.  The man paddled to where the boy sat, and pushed the boat to the bank, climbing out and fastening it easily to a little tree.

He pulled himself up the bank and sat down in the shade next to the boy, dropping his heavy pack next to him, sighing.  “It’s already a hot day.  You’ve found a nice spot.”

The boy looked at him, but did not answer.  The man smiled.  “You’re a long way out here to be on your own, young fellow.”

The boy shrugged dismissively.  “It’s not so far.  I know where I’m going.”

The man laughed.  “Do you now?  Well excellent then.  Two weary travelers, both who know where they’re headed, taking a break in the shade.”  He reached into his pack and took out a loaf of bread.  He tore himself a piece, and a piece for the boy.  He handed one over.  “Hungry?”

The boy nodded, and took it, and ate a bite.  He looked at the man.  “Thank you.”

“We have to look out for each other out here on the open road, don’t we?  Or open creek, in my case.”  The boy smiled.

They ate in silence, and though the man saw the lines of tears that had been left in the dirt on the boy’s face, he didn’t say anything to the boy about it.  Instead he went to the stream and refilled his canteen, and walked back up the bank.

“Where are you headed then?”

The boy gestured down the trail.  “That way.”

The man nodded.  “I’m headed that way myself.  My boat doesn’t require as much walking though, if you’d like a ride.”

The boy looked at the boat, and at the man, and knew that his legs were already tired from running so far this morning, and from sleeping on grass last night, and knew too that he wanted to find the village as quickly as he could, to begin to look for his sister.  He looked at the man.  “I need to find my sister.  Can you take me to the village?”

The man looked downstream, and back at the boy.  “I can do that.”

The boy stood up.  “Thank you.”

They were on the water, the sound of it soothing against the side of the boat, though the sun was no more forgiving here than on the road.  The man did all the paddling, and the boy sat in the prow, looking out over the water.  He looked at both sides of the bank keenly, hoping to catch sight of some hint of his sister.  The man noticed his looking, but paddled in silence for a time.  After an hour or more, he spoke.

“What happened to your sister, little traveler?”

The boy turned from where he was sitting, and dropped back down into the boat, sitting on a cross plank.  He shook his head.  “I don’t know.”  He kept looking at the sides of the bank, though he felt tired.  He had run and run to try to find her, and being sad, sitting beneath the sun with the sound of the waves had made him drowsy.  “She was just gone this morning.”

The man turned a quizzical eye to him, lifting the paddle out of the water and setting it flat across the boat, letting the current do the work for a time.  “Gone how?”

The boy turned his head as if he was again looking at the bank, but his eyes were blurring with tears.  He did not want the man to see.  “I don’t know.  We slept, and I dreamed, and then she was gone when I woke.”

The man nodded, and murmured to himself.  “So that is why the creek spoke.”

The boy turned to look at him, surprised.  “What did you say?”

The man looked up.  “Nothing.  A fancy of mine, and no more.”  He paused, then smiled, dipping the oar back in the water.  “When we get to the village, I will help you find someone who might be able to assist you better.”

The boy pressed him again about what he had said of the creek, but the man would say nothing else.  Letting it be, he turned again in the boat and watched the banks, not expecting to see anything, but hoping to all the same.  It was nearing dusk by the time they pulled into view of the village, and they had been much farther than the boy expected.  He would have been walking all day and much of the next if he had tried to stay on the trail, and though it meant that if his sister had been somehow on the path further ahead he might have missed her, he felt certain that this was not the case.  She lay ahead of him somewhere, in the village or beyond, he was sure.

The man paddled the boat up to the shore and they both leapt out, splashing into the water a bit, pulling the craft further up the beach.  The boy helped, one hand on the boat and the other holding the paddle while the man pulled it all the way into the sand, beyond the rise of where the water might reach with the tide.  The man smiled and took the paddle back, and lifted his pack out, and flipped the boat over to keep it from filling with rain in the night.  They walked up the shore, the boy’s steps slightly behind his, up weathered wooden stairs sunken into the hill, by the side of a house that extended out over it, supported on stilts.  A few chickens pecked beneath the raised house, ignoring them both as they walked past.

The man clasped arms and hands with many of the people in the inn.  He was full of smiles and greetings for them, and they for him.  It was nice inside, shaded from the sun, a little breeze coming in through a round window, and he went and sat next to it, hoping that the man had not forgotten about him, and his sister.  He had not looked back at him or said anything to him since they arrived, but the boy thought it would be better to wait.  The man had gotten him this far, he would trust him a while longer.  He closed his eyes and leaned back against the wall, letting the sound of people talking and pints of beer being served and the breeze through the little portal window whispering all mingle in his head, and before he knew it, he was asleep.

He woke with a bit of a start, the warm scent of a bowl of soup being placed in front of him on the table.  He looked up and there was a woman smiling at him, and the man had sat down in the seat next to him.

“I see you found an excellent spot once again.  I will remember to take your lead on such things from now on.”  He smiled at the boy, and the boy returned it.  “We have soup.”  The woman returned with a second bowl and put it in front of the man, and set down two wooden spoons.  She smiled and tussled the boy’s hair, which he found bothersome, but smiled back because she meant it nicely.

“Thank you for the soup.  I will repay you when I can.”

The man laughed, but nodded his head.  “Yes, when you can.  Like I said though, we travelers have to look out for one another.  Perhaps you will share with someone else, when they need it, and that will be payment enough.”

The boy nodded, and decided to do that, should he have the chance.  He took a spoonful and ate it, and though it was hot and burned his mouth a little, he looked at the man and said “It’s very good.”

“I’m glad you like it.  They always have excellent soup.”  He ate a few spoonfuls, and they sat quietly, listening to the people coming in, dusk having turned to evening while the boy slept, customers for drink and dinner, some alone, others loudly with friends in tow.  He looked over at the boy, finishing a spoonful, and said “I spoke with a man about your sister.”

The boy looked at him expectantly.  “Did he know where she is?”

The man shook his head.  “No, I’m afraid he did not.  But he said there was another man here, in the early morning.  A man on a horse that arrived at a gallop, a little girl in his arms.  He said the man seemed quite anxious to find help for her.”

“Was she sick?  Or hurt?”

The man shrugged.  “I don’t know.  No one could say what was wrong with her.  She would not wake, but that was all.  He got a room for her and let her rest there while he bought supplies.  They said that he was intending to head across the mountains, that there are better healers beyond them.  They said he left in the early afternoon.”

The boy sat quietly for a few moments, and set down his spoon.  He looked back at the man.  “I have to go after them, then.”

The man looked seriously at the boy, and put a hand on his shoulder.  “I know you want to follow them.  But rest tonight, and eat.  They are on a horse, and he likely knows the road.  You have no horse, and do not know the mountains, nor where you would go should you reach them, or even get beyond them.”

They sat silently again for a few moments.  The man tapped the boy’s spoon with his own, a comforting smile on his face.  “You should try to eat, my little traveling friend.  You cannot leave in the dark, and you will never find her if you leave weak and hungry.”  The boy did not move immediately, but eventually he nodded, and began again to eat the soup.  Sad and frustrated, he was still surprisingly hungry, and the woman had brought him a second bowl before he realized he was done with the first.  The man laughed at his appetite, and the boy smiled in spite of himself.

“I will sleep in the hay loft,” the boy said as he stood from the table.  “Thank you for the soup.”

The man nodded.  “I have arranged a room for myself, you could sleep on the floor, or a cot there if you would like.”

The boy shook his head.  “I will be happy with the sound of the horses.  I have my sister’s blanket, and I will be comfortable in the hay.”

The man stood, and extended his hand.  “Then I bid you goodnight, little friend.  Sleep well.  Find me when you wake, I will be here in the morning.  We may speak to others, and perhaps find a plan for you to seek after your sister.”

The boy shook the man’s hand, and nodded.  “Goodnight.”

He walked outside into the night air, and was struck by the sudden silence, the dark, the cool, and the loneliness.  Now he wished he had not so readily turned down the offer of a cot or the floor.  The sky was dark, there was no moon, and the pinpricks of light were brilliant but distant, and served only somehow to remind him of his sister, and the fact that she was gone.  He turned and walked away from the door, and walked along the side of the inn, toward the stables.  He looked at the sky, and he thought of her, and new tears began to trace fresh lines of dirt on his face.  He sat down beside the stable door on a log and though he did not weep, he cried softly, and watched the traces of clouds pass across the starlight.

He thought of how far they had walked, he and his sister, down the long trail.  He thought of what they had left behind, but he did not have room for more sorrow now, and did not think on it long.  He thought of her laugh and how certain - and bossy - she always was about things.  He thought of the dream he had dreamt the night before, how strange to have dreamt that a man rode off with his sister, hurt or sick, only to have it be just the same as he woke.  He was still quite certain that dreams do not carry people off before they wake, but it was still rather strange, and he puzzled about it.  Things seemed less certain and sure at night, in the dark but for starlight, cool air on his face.  It was silly and he knew it, but he hoped that if he slept he could dream again, and follow after them faster than he would be able to do while waking.

Thinking such sleepy thoughts, he pulled open the stable door and groped around for the ladder.  It was harder to find than he expected, with the door swinging shut he couldn’t see much at all, but inching his way about he managed to find it, and clamber up into the hayloft above.  He tried to wrap the blanket around him so that he would be warm beneath it, and keep some of it between him and the sharp pokes of the hay, but the blanket wasn’t big enough.  Eventually though the weariness of the day overcame him, and he fell asleep.  And very soon he dreamed.

He was in a boat, which if he had been aware of it, would not have been surprising since he had been on one most of the day.  In his dream he was the one paddling, and the current was smooth but quite swift, and it was moving the boat along much faster than he was used to.  He had only been in a few boats before, and most for fishing on broad and even lakes, not in swift currents through moving water.  He was not on a creek but a wide river, and there were other people in boats, most moving with the current, a few against but going slowly, many men pulling oars on single boats to make any progress.  The boy was anxious and troubled though, for he knew he was to be keeping watch to the sides of the river for something, but he could not remember for what.  He was struggling to paddle, to keep the boat moving straight, and the riverbanks seemed to grow farther and farther apart, and it became harder to watch them and paddle at the same time.  He was letting long stretches of the river go by without looking to either side, so focused on the paddling that he could not spare a moment to look, and he began to grow frustrated and upset, but he could do nothing but paddle on.  Finally he gave up on looking to the sides, and just paddled.  When he stopped trying so hard to do both, the paddling seemed to easier, and he was able to look out over the water, if not closely watch the riverbank, as he skimmed atop it.

He realized that in the current the water’s surface had a kind of shape, that there were large ripples and patches of water moving differently than the rest, that it seemed not just to be one large river, but many currents all woven together, like fibers woven in a rope or string, each one rushing in its own motion, but all together, at once, drawing them ever forward.  He looked down to his side, and it seemed as if it looked back, without eyes but with something deep down inside of it, in the depths where light no longer reflected, as if it could see him from there.  And it occurred to him in his dream that the river might know what he was supposed to be looking for.  He had forgotten what it was, but not that he was to do it.  He could feel the press of it in him, that he should look, that his eyes should be open, but for what and why he could not recall.

And dreaming he thought to himself, and to the water if it could hear him, what is it I should be watching for?  I have forgotten, he thought, and he thought it loudly.  Where should I go?

And then everything was very still, and as ever in a dream he was now somewhere else that was still the same place, in a boat but in a swamp, between the trunks of cypress trees and in the mists of an early morning, well before the sun would rise.  And he thought to himself, this is strange, I think the water has answered me, but I do not know what to make of such a thing.  He pulled himself close to a cypress tree, and he stood in the boat, and he placed one foot out on a cypress stump, and he looked before him and behind him, and he looked above him and below him.  Below him in the water he could see minnows swimming in the shallows between the submerged trunks and the surface, and above him he could see moss, but before him and behind him he could only see fog.  A small black snake swam between his legs where he stood over the water, and he thought that it looked brilliant, but he drew back a little all the same.

As he sat back down in the boat, there was the soft neighing of a horse, and it woke him from his dream.  He looked about but it was not dawn yet, and he curled back into his blanket, and fell down into a dreamless sleep for the rest of the night.

He woke to the sound of the stable doors banging open, and morning light flooded in through them.  He sat up blinking, hay sticking into his blanket as he pulled it from him, and he looked down through the wooden slats of the loft.  Two men were leading their horses out of the stable, pulling down their tackle, and a third passed them on his way in, and began mucking out the stalls.  There were few words exchanged, some nods and murmurs, and the man working in the stable began to whistle quietly.  The boy gathered his blanket up and shook the hay from it, and wrapping it again around his sister’s shoes, climbed down the ladder and walked out into the yard.

It was early but people were already making their way about the streets, a few shops already open, proprietors on the doorsteps sweeping and busying, fishermen who had been out in the very early morning bringing in a catch, people with carts of wheat and corn to be brought to the mill, pushing them along.  People readying to buy and sell, preparing to begin another day.  The boy was from a place very much like it, and though it was too early in the morning for homesickness now, he missed it a little all the same.  But there was a whole day ahead of him yet, important decisions to be made, plans to be thought of and acted on.  The man had said he would try to help, and the boy was already impatient to be on his way, whether he had a plan or no.  Turning toward the door of the inn, the boy resolved that he would be on his way by no later than noon, come what may.

The man met him as promised, but he said he had things he must attend to first, people he needed to see, things to buy, things from his pack to barter and sell.  There was nothing the boy could do but wait, and so he did.  At first he wandered with the man to the many places he seemed to need to go, but after a while he grew weary of standing just outside the door while the man spoke in low tones to people he did not know.  He promised to meet the man again by the inn in time for lunch, and set off on his own to look about the town.

There was a lot to see, the town was a bit bigger than his own.  There were two entirely separate blacksmiths, which was something he would not have imagined anyone could need.  There was another inn, nicer, he thought, than the one he had eaten in the night before, at least from the outside.  He didn’t go in though, deciding there wasn’t much that was very special to see inside an inn.  He walked down toward the far side of the town, and saw a few streets all spreading out, small houses dotting the sides, clothes hung out to dry on lines, women talking to other women while children, younger than he himself to be sure, played in the street.  He walked back toward the center of town, and there he saw a thing that he stopped to look at.  There was a small house to the side of some of the other shops, but that wasn’t surprising on its own.  There was a pair of antlers, small ones, on the door near the latch, and though it took him a moment to remember, he thought that he had seen them before, in his dream.  He walked up to the door and looked at them, and the more he looked the more certain he became.  He reached out and knocked, because the door was not open and he was not sure who might be inside.

He knocked and he waited, and for a moment he heard no movement.  Then he heard a chair scuff across the floor, but then once more, nothing.  He almost knocked again, but decided not to, and began to turn and walk away.  Just as he did so, the door opened, and an old man with a pair of glasses on stuck his head out.  “Yes?  Who was knocking?”

The boy turned around and looked back at the old man, but the man did not seem to see him.  A young woman, younger than his mother had been, but not much, pulled the door further open, and looked down at the boy, and smiled.  “Grandpa, he’s right here.  It’s a young boy.  Your glasses are terrible.”

“My glasses are just fine.  People should be less blurry, it makes them look like the road.  Especially short ones who stand too far away.” The old man sniffed as he said it, and the boy had trouble not smiling.  “Well, yes, what did you want then?” the old man asked.

The boy was quiet, because he was not entirely sure what to say.  He did not know what he wanted, except to find his sister, but that wasn’t really what the man was asking.  The boy shrugged, and looked at the ground, thinking.  He looked back up, but he spoke more to the young woman than the old man, because the old man was staring into the street, still not really able to see him.  “I don’t know.  The antlers on your door, I thought I recognized them, is all.  I don’t know why I knocked.”

The young woman stepped out and turned to look at the antlers on the door, and then back at the boy.  “These?” she said as she pointed.  “They’re just a dirty old pair of bones.  Not that antlers are bones.  You know what I mean.” She said and she laughed a little.

The boy smiled in return.  “I had a dream two nights ago, and they were in it.  When I woke up, my sister was gone, and I’m looking for her.”

The young woman’s face turned serious, and she extended a hand to the boy.  “Come here and tell me that again.”

The boy walked nearer her, and as he did the old man turned his head and looked a bit startled.  “Ah-hah!  There you are,” he said.  “It is rude to stand in the middle of the street while being so short, holding a conversation with people who can’t very well see you if you insist on being blurry.”  He said it very gruffly, but he pulled open the door and the young woman led the boy inside.  The boy did not think he really meant it.  Once they were inside, the man pulled a chair away from the table, and gestured for him to sit.  The young woman sat to his side, and the old man down across from him.  It was a rough table, not fancy but very sturdy, and there was a little fire in the hearth, water in the kettle beginning to boil.  There were roots tied from the rafters, and dried grasses, and bits of sticks, strips of bark, and sacks full of scented things.  Altogether it smelled like bitter but not unpleasant tea, as if it had been somehow spilled in the air and left to dry.  When they had all sat down, the young woman turned to him and took his hand.  She seemed very nice, the boy thought.

“Tell me about the dream you had,” she said quietly.

The boy took a moment and thought, and tried to remember it clearly.  He could not put all the pieces back together.  There had been a city, but he did not know what city or what kind of people, and there had been a door with antlers, like the one leading here, but they had fallen off the door as they went in.  And there had been something strange in the shop, he thought, but it was blank, like it had left his thoughts, just an empty space until suddenly he was trying to help his sister stand, and the man lifted her and spirited her away.  He told the young woman all of this, and she sat quietly, and the old man cleared his throat quite purposefully.  When he was sure the boy was done, he began to speak.

“Your sister was the girl that was brought here yesterday, then.”

The boy started up from his chair.  “You saw her?  Here?  Was she hurt, or sick?  The man who brought me here told me someone had said she was ill.”

The old man nodded, and the young woman put her hand on his arm comfortingly.  The old man spoke.  “I’m sorry boy, but she was ill.  I don’t know how, or of what.  Something beyond my little knowledge.  Something I could not fix or mend.”  He paused, and his voice was quiet.  He seemed sad, more than sad just for the boy.  “I tried though.  I did all I knew to do.”

“What was wrong with her?” The boy demanded, though he did not mean it to be rude.

The old man shook his head, and the young woman spoke.  “We don’t know, little one.  We have roots to cure coughs and colds, herbs to put strength back into broken bones.  We have powders to wake those that sleep, or to put to sleep those that cannot.  We can mend a wound and help it heal, and we can draw poison from a sting.  But your sister was not hurt in her body.  There were no herbs to give her, no powder nor bit of bark nor tea of leaves.  She would not wake, but it was not sleep alone that held her.”

They sat silently for a time, and the young woman got up and took the kettle from the fire, and with it she made tea for the three of them.  It was, like the air, bitter, but warm and curiously comforting.  The old man sighed, and he patted the boy’s hand.  “They went across the mountains, if you did not hear.  There are finer healers there, those with knowledge of things that are beyond sticks and stones that break men’s bones.  They know things I am not certain people should know, but that they must to heal what has been caused by like.”

The boy did not know what he meant, but he nodded, because he felt as if he knew, even if he could not think it clearly.  “I must go to them.  I must find her.”

The old man shook his head, and the young woman sighed sadly, and touched his shoulder.  She said to him “There is no way for you to find her, little one.  They have gone much faster than you can go, down a road you do not know, into mountains you are far too small to cross.  They travel deep into the wood on the other side, a forest many days wide in all directions, even if you know where you intend to go.  And if you don’t, you will find yourself in swamps and marsh, and lost utterly among the snakes and wild things.”

The boy shook his head.  “Then why are there healers there, and better than you?”

The old man shrugged his shoulders.  “That is just the way of it, boy.”

The boy thanked them and they showed him out, though he could hear them talking behind him as he walked away.  It did not matter that the way is to be hard, he thought to himself.  I must go anyway.  I must find her.  He returned to the inn, because it was nearing noon and he was not on his way, as he had resolved to be.  He had no plan.  He arrived to the inn and looked inside, but the man had not yet returned, and so he sat down outside on a rock to wait, hoping that when he returned, he would have had better luck in devising some way to go after his sister.

When the man returned, he tussled the boy’s hair as he walked by him, and the boy stood up and followed him into the inn.  The man called for a lunch of bread and ham and cheese, and the boy was too hungry to refuse it, though he thanked the man again.  As they ate, the boy asked him “Did anyone have a plan for how I can find my sister?”  The man chewed his mouthful of food slowly, and set down the knife he was using to slice chunks of cheese.

“I’m sorry little one.  I spoke with no fewer than three men who have traveled through these woods and to the mountains.  They said that they have rarely crossed them, themselves, having no need.  Trade is usually up and down the creek here, and on to the towns north and south.  The mountains are to the west, and there is little trade that goes through there, not being worth the trouble of the high and treacherous routes through the cliffs and stones.  No one here knows a safe passage through, and no one has horses fast enough to catch a man with a full day’s lead.”

The boy looked at him, crestfallen.  “What do you mean?”

He looked sadly at the boy, and said “I mean, my little friend, that no one here believes you will be able to catch up to them.  And no one has the time or resources to try to go west across the mountains.”

“No one will help me, then?”

The man shook his head.  “It is not that no one wishes to.  They just do not believe there is any way for you to succeed.  More than one home offered to give you a place to stay, food to eat, and help in trying to find your way home to your family.”

The boy looked down at his bread, and said nothing.  The man looked at him, puzzled.  “You do have family around here, don’t you son?  How did you get out this way?”

The boy shook his head, but would say nothing.  He pressed his eyes shut to keep from crying here in front of everyone.  He was not so young now that he could cry like a child in front of people.  He breathed deeply, and rubbed his eyes on his sleeve.  The man tried to speak but the boy shook his head.  “No.  I do not have anyone.  Just her.”

The man was silent and his face was very sad and serious.  “I did not know.  I thought perhaps you had run away, were having an adventure with your sister.”

The boy stood up from the table.  “Thank you for the food.  I need to go now.”

The man put his hand on the boy’s shoulder and looked at him seriously.  “Son, please sit down, eat with me.  We must figure something out.  You’re too young to be on your own.”

The boy shook his head.  “No, I’m not.”

The man said firmly, “I’m sorry little traveler, but you are.  You cannot find or buy food for yourself, and you have no shelter but your blanket.  You need a home, a family.  Stay with me, we will find someone who can take care of you.”

The boy said back just as firmly, “I will take care of myself.  And my sister.  I promised.”  And he pulled away from the man’s hand and he walked for the door.  The man stood up and grabbed him by the elbow.

“Little friend, please.  Listen to me.”

The boy now had tears in his eyes and he was angry and sad and scared and he felt very alone.  He looked at the man and though he did not mean to, he shouted at him.  “Leave me alone!  I will find her on my own!”  He pulled away again and ran through the door and down the street.  The man rushed out the door and watched as the boy ran off toward the middle of town.  At least, the man thought, he is running into the town, and not toward the woods.  He will change his mind when he’s realized how far away the mountains are and how hard the trip will be, and he’ll come back.  I’ll wait for him, the man thought, here at the inn, and when he returns, we will find a place for him to live.
