Epistle Ten, Illusion.

If the garishness of this mask fails us in our hope, I must beg your pardon and your pause, to listen for a moment more.  Three upon the wheel, and should you dodge the wolf, to the raven you may yet fall.  Be vigilant against the treachery of the lamb.

What is divine, is not.  I have imagined and you have.  Only the flickering moments of mortal, are.

I have been a prophet to an imaginary god.

The flesh of a deity our own, the skin and bone and tree and stone of our bodies and the substance of the earth.  The unyielding of a rockslide, the form of birds in flight, the failing habits of a man, the waves and tides of history.  Minded.  Conscious, an impulse directing the manifestation beyond the awareness and participation of such component parts.  And though the divine is not, there are such strange patterns beyond thought and deed as to evoke an image of a thing behind, a being coalescing of a behavior or a pattern or a current of the wind.

They were never born.  Without hands or feet or clothes or thoughts but in the playing out of event in time.  But they give shape, and in that shape they have hand and foot, the mounting of rhetoric the pounding heartbeat of a god, a spirit thing made manifest in shouts and cries of bloodlust or joy, the swarming mass of people no more themselves but something else, transformed.  The surge of events and history given width and depth and height - a pin into a map in an isolated room, the whisper of one to another of shackles that should not be, the sound of rebellion trumpeted in the streets, the blood of a boy dying in a soldier’s rag.  The thought and form of a beast unlike man, manifested shape as time.

Unreal, are we not the masters of our fate?  Have we not the responsibility of our act, the freedom of will to be?  Is not all else but fantasy, constructed of symbols dredged from depths of our ever-teeming minds, formative only of that which we grant and give?

Was Christ other than the cross upon which he was borne?  Was revolution other than the guillotine?

I kept to the interstate as much as possible, trying not to stop except for gas and food.  There wasn’t anything I was driving home to find beyond a headstone and a final confirmation.  I didn’t want to talk to John about it.  Didn’t want to go see Mike, start therapy, or take medication.  Worse though, I didn’t want to go back to my life.  Delusional or no, I’d had plenty of reasons to leave.  Not a single one would have changed while I was gone.

I got home and unpacked.  Put the journals and photographs in my bedroom closet, found the little glass flower Isabella had given me, left it in its box and put it with the closet with the rest.  I didn’t know what else to do with it.  I kept Mallory’s journals separate, decided to read through them again.  Not for any reason but that they were hers.  I drove by the cemetery the day after I got back, but couldn’t work up the courage to go in.  I remembered where she was buried, remembered the ceremony and all the rest now.  I just didn’t know if I wanted to try to face it yet.

Home wasn’t.  Just a place I remembered, streets and buildings I recognized, knew the back streets and the best places for lunch.  Found myself driving around like I was lost, looking for something.  I was, I guess, but I already knew where she was.  But it wasn’t the buried sister I was looking for, it was the other one.  Driving around trying to avoid places I thought I might run into people I knew.  I started shopping at a different market, trying to get there early instead of in the afternoon or evening.  My rent was paid for another few weeks, I was buying groceries off the last of the money I’d taken on the trip.  I hadn’t decided what I was going to do.

John called a few times, came by once.  I was blank.  I didn’t resent his company, but didn’t ask for it either.  Slipping past him without ever hanging up or leaving sight.  He didn’t stop trying but he gave me some space.  I didn’t even know if I wanted any.  There was just nothing.  Mallory was gone, but I could have dealt with that.  There was just nothing here for me.  Like more than I’d ever recognized I was empty, my life just so much debris, not even so broken as to make a worthy cautionary tale.  Blank, without form, void, but no great darkness or deep.  I looked through the paper at job postings.  What I was qualified for was nothing I wanted, no better or worse than what I could get when I was eighteen.

A need to start over.  Driving out across the country was obviously that urge, though I didn’t know it until it was done.  A new life somewhere better, where there would be purpose and meaning just waiting to be found, hidden in prettier hills or among more clever friends, maybe in the abandon of a new affair or lover.  Anything.  I felt like anything would be enough, something to invigorate, to bring my desiccated shell back to a semblance of life.  One better and more worth living than the remnants of what I could find in my apartment and quiet streets.

Eventually I didn’t have much of a choice but to to talk to Mike.  I didn’t know what I was going to do, only had about two weeks left on my rent before I had to figure something out.  John could probably help me cover it if I needed, but I wasn’t going to ask him to pay for an apartment I didn’t even know if I wanted to keep.  I called Mike, asked if I could come by.  He found some time in his schedule and worked me in.  I drove to the hospital.  It felt strange to be pulling into the parking lot for myself, not for Mallory.  This was her place, not mine.  Front of the building like it was looking at me, wondering what I was doing here, passively but distinctly taking note of my steps, my posture, of what must be going on in my head.  Bricks and mortar analyzing me before I walked in the door.

Mike’s office door was open, I knocked on it as I walked in.  He looked up and smiled.

“Hi, Chris.  Thanks for coming in.”  He got up, leaned across the desk and shook my hand.  I shook it back.

“Thanks for making some time to see me.”

“Absolutely.”

He sat down, gestured to a chair, and I sat as well, neither of us speaking for a few moments.  He closed a book and slid it to the side of his desk, clearing his throat.  “How are you doing?”

I shrugged, turning a little in my seat.  Already uncomfortable.  “Alright, I guess.”

“Good.  Seen any more of your sister since we talked last?”

“No.”

He nodded.  “You can tell me, if you have.  If it helps, I don’t think you’re crazy, at least not in a long-term pathological sense.  I think you’ve just had a really rough time of it lately.”

“Thanks.  But I haven’t seen her.  No voices or anything like that.”

“Ok.”  He waited for a minute, picked up a pen idly, tapping it against the desk, leaning back in his chair.  “I’m not really much good at this kind of thing.  Talk therapy isn’t really my area of expertise.  I can recommend someone, if you’d like.”

I shook my head a little.  “I can’t really afford anything like that.  And I’ll be alright.  I just think I need to get my head straight about some things.”

“Like what?”

I laughed a little.  “Like what to do with my life.”

He smiled briefly.  “What do you want to do?”

“I don’t have to waste your time with this, Mike.  I can find a career fair or a job counselor or something.”

“Is that the problem?  Your job?”

I stopped.  Looked at him for a minute.  “No.  It doesn’t help, but no.”

“What is, then?”

“I don’t know.  Not knowing seems like part of the problem.”

He nodded.  “How long have we known each other, Chris?  Since Mallory was here the first time… ten years ago, roughly?”

“Yeah.”

“You were just a kid when all of this started.  This is just my opinion, and I’m not blaming you, but it always seemed to me like you never really picked out a life for yourself.  At least not one that wasn’t just waiting for the next time Mallory would need you, anyway.”

“She was my sister.  What was I supposed to do?”

“Like I said, I’m not blaming you.  You did what you thought you had to.  But it’s Ok if you’re feeling pretty messed up right now.  It’s not just about her dying, is it?  It’s about having to be something else.  Something more than her brother in the background.”

I didn’t answer.  It didn’t really need an answer, he wasn’t really asking.  I sat there quietly, not sure what I was thinking.  Not sure what I should be thinking.

“You don’t have to figure it out all at once.  You know that, right?  If it takes a few months just to feel like you’re on your feet again, that’s Ok.”

“What do I do until then?  I can’t go back to the way it was.  I can’t pick up another kitchen job, go back to throw-away nights out, everything in my life disposable.  I’ll go crazy.”

“Don’t, then.”

“I have to pay rent, Mike.  I have to buy groceries.  No one’s going to do that for me.”

He nodded.  “You should move out of your apartment, get a different one, just for a change of scenery.  Try not to be back in the same mental space.  There are always jobs opening up here.  Nothing fancy, janitorial work, kitchen and food service.  Maybe a position as an orderly.  But something different than what you’re doing now.  I can put in a word for you.”

I didn’t answer immediately.  Mike shrugged.  “No pressure.  I’m just offering.”

I looked up.  “You’d do that for me?”

“Yeah, I would.  Doesn’t have to be forever, just something to do while you try to figure out what you want to do next.  Change of lifestyle, too, not being in kitchens all night.  Work more regular shifts, that sort of thing.”

I nodded.  “I’d like that.”

He smiled.  “Good.  I’ll talk to HR, get something set up.  You free for an interview tomorrow?”

“I am.”

We shook hands again, he walked with me a little way down the hall.  I thanked him, he said he’d have them call me to set up a time.  It wasn’t much, but it was something.  Felt like something different, a forward step.  I walked out of the building, and realized I was smiling.

On the way home I drove past the cemetery.  There was no reason to avoid it any longer.  The world was moving on, whether I moved with it or not.  I pulled into the long, winding drive, slowly and taking my time, thinking it was a pretty afternoon.  Sunlight was coming down, flashing on the leaves, with enough breeze to make them seem to shimmer with movement, but not much more.  The air was cool, I drove with the window down.  The little road through the cemetery split, I took the right fork, and drove until I got closer to Mallory’s grave.  I parked and got out of the car.

I looked out over the headstones.  The hearse had parked not far from where I was now.  John and I, with a few others, had carried the casket to the grave site.  There had been a few people standing, waiting.  Not many.  Mallory hadn’t really held on to too many friends.  The people who did show up were mostly friends of mine, passing acquaintances of hers.  Mike and a few of the staff from the hospital had come out to show support.  Once we’d placed the casket John had gone to stand with Maria, who had been crying into a tissue quietly.  I had gone to stand next to them.  I couldn’t really remember what the minister said.  I think he’d seemed kind enough, did his best not to sound as if it was just another funeral.  I suppose it was.  I was asked to say a few words but I stumbled over them, didn’t manage to say anything profound.  John spoke too, though most of what he said was for my benefit, his eyes catching mine while he talked.

That day had been gray, almost suitably so.  This one was bright.  I walked over to her headstone.  The sod they’d placed over the grave was taking root.  You could tell it was more recently placed than the rest, but it didn’t look too unnatural; once winter came and went, you wouldn’t be able to tell.  I knelt down and put my hand in the grass, reaching for her through it, though not desperately.  I sat down and looked at the headstone.  Thirty-two years old, loving sister.  John had handled picking out the headstone.  I couldn’t tell if I should smile or tear up that this was the last anyone would ever know of her.  A whole life reduced to dates and a sentence fragment.  I found myself talking before I realized I was going to.

“I miss you, Mal.”

I stopped like I was waiting for a response.  I picked at the grass.

“You probably don’t know this, but it turns out I hallucinated you on and off for like two months.”

I hesitated.  What little smile was left on my face faded.  The breeze seemed to hush.

“I guess I wish I knew why.  Why you did it, why you didn’t just talk to me about whatever it was.  What was so bad that you decided it wasn’t worth it anymore.  I don’t know.  I never understood your reasons when you tried before, I guess.  Maybe you didn’t think I’d understand these, either.”

A leaf dropped down from a tree overhanging, I picked it up, began to tear at it absently.

“I’m not too mad at you, if that helps.  Maybe I should be.  But maybe you’re happier now.  I hope so, I know it was always hard for you.”

I wiped at my eyes, frustrated.

“I don’t know how to do this.  I feel stupid, talking to the ground.  You’re not in there.  You were easier to talk to when I was hallucinating you, you know that?”  I laughed a little, my voice husky.

“I don’t know what the hell to do now, Mal.”  I stopped, and took a breath.  I shrugged noncommittally, like she could read my body language.  “Mike just offered me a job, so that’s good I guess.  He says I should move somewhere, to a different apartment at least, try to get into a better mental space.  I think I might.”

I stood up, not really intending to leave.  Just felt like I couldn’t sit still.

“He says I never really picked out a life for myself.  That I just lived one in the background, waiting on you.”  I paused, paced a few steps, looking around.  “He’s probably right.  But I don’t know what that means for me, y’know?  What am I supposed to do?  I don’t know how to actually live a life.  I don’t even know what I’d want to do.”

She was quiet, just like she should be.  The headstone didn’t answer.  The earth didn’t quake and there were no prophecies or ghosts or strange signs.  Just the sun still shining down, the breeze picking softly back up again.  Trail of a jet high overhead.  I walked to the headstone and brushed a little twig off the top.

“I’m gonna go.  I’ll be back around, not sure exactly when.”

I took a few steps, then turned.

“I love you, Mallory.  I’m sorry I didn’t see what was wrong in time to help.”

I moved.  I had just enough left from the trip for the first month’s rent in a new place, John helped me with the security deposit.  The apartment wasn’t really any nicer, but Mike was right, just being in a different physical space made some of it easier.  I started the new job, too, on the janitorial staff at the hospital.  Mike said he’d be keeping an eye out for an orderly position for me, when the next one was available.  I didn’t really mind either way, for now.  My life wasn’t qualitatively better, but I felt like something was different.  I felt like I had a chance.  Less trapped.

I’d been working at the hospital for a few weeks before we ran into one another.  I didn’t even see her, I don’t think she saw me either, until we’d almost bumped into one another.  I recognized her, but it took me a minute to put it together.  I could see confusion on her face too at first, trying to place me.

“Stephanie?”

“Yes?”

“I’m Chris, Mallory’s brother.”

“Oh… my god.”

“Jesus, it is you.  I… I guess I forgot you’d even be here.  Hi.”

“Yeah, hi.  When did you start working here?”

“A few weeks ago.  Mike Nelson got me a job.”

“Oh.  Oh, I mean, that’s great.  I’m glad.”

“Yeah.  It was nice of him.”

She nodded.  “Well, it’s good to see you.  I was sorry to hear about your sister.  I’d like to talk, but I’ve got a patient waiting.”

“No, sure, that’s fine.”  I hesitated, and she began to walk away.  I turned after her, and asked.  “Hey… could we get together some time?  I have a few questions… about Mallory and… well, the rest of it.”

She looked back, pausing but not stopping.  “Yeah.  We can do that.”

“Ok, great.”

She walked off before I could ask her anything else.  I decided not to follow after her.  If she still worked here, I could try to find her again later.  I hadn’t really thought about any of the trip, the journals, or the rest of it over the last few weeks.  Trying to just let it be, to quiet whatever madness had hold of me before.  Letting it subside, the intensity of it fade, and try instead to simply stabilize.  But I had questions.

It was a few days before I saw her again.  I was pulling the garbage out of a break room waste bin, she walked in with a bagel.  She looked up and saw me, her face blanched a little.  I smiled.

“Hey.”

“Hi.”

She kept from making eye contact much, just went to the toaster, put her bagel in and stood there watching it.  I tied off the garbage and replaced it with a new plastic bag, put the lid back on the can.

“I’d like a chance to talk to you about Mallory, when you have time.”

She turned to look back at me.  “Ok.”

“When would work for you?”

“I don’t really know.  I’m pretty busy.”

I nodded.  “I understand.  Maybe this weekend?”

“I’m working this weekend.”

“On a lunch break then, or in the evening.  It won’t take long, I don’t want to waste your time.”

She looked past me into the hall, like she could get away by staring.  “How about Saturday?  I usually try to have lunch around one, one-thirty.”

“That’d be great.  Where?”

“Coffee shop down the street from here?”

“Sure.”

I picked up the bag and walked out, leaving her alone.  I wanted to know, but I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable.  Whatever she knew, she could just as easily not tell me or lie about it as help me in any real way.  I felt like the best way to get her to help was to do it on her terms as much as possible.

We met like she’d said, I got there a little early, sat outside and waited.  Sipping at coffee to seem casual.  She walked up, I smiled and waved but didn’t stand.  She walked to the table and set down a brown paper bag.

“I’m going to go get something to drink.  You want anything?”

I gestured with my paper cup.  “I’m Ok.”

She walked in, returned a few minutes later.  She pulled her chair out and sat down.  She didn’t open her bag, or drink her coffee.  She just looked down at the table quietly.

“Everything alright?”

She shook her head.  “No.”

“If this is a bad time, we can reschedule.  I don’t want to put you out.”

She looked up.  “The problem is what you want to talk about, not when we do it.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, and didn’t answer.  She waited for a few minutes, then reached over toward her lunch like she’d made a decision.  She pulled it open and took out a sandwich.

“So, what do you want to know?”

I looked past her and out into the parking lot.  I had a lot I wanted to know.  I didn’t know how much of it I could really ask, or what she’d know about it.  I decided to start small.

“Tell me about the time you spent with my sister.”

“She was a patient.  I didn’t spend much time with her.”

“I had the impression that you paid a little more attention to her than some of the other nurses.”

“Who told you that?”

“It doesn’t really matter.  Did you?”

She hesitated.  “Maybe a little.  She seemed like she needed help.”

“Don’t they all?”

She shrugged.  “Some more than others.  Some patients are more able to be helped than others.  Your sister was looking for someone to help her.  She didn’t want to… be going through what she was.”

“Did she tell you that?”

“Not in so many words, but yeah.”

I nodded.  I didn’t answer immediately, drinking some of my coffee.  She ate a little of her sandwich.  Eventually I spoke again.

“I know she was acting strangely when she came in that last time.  Prophesying or something, from what I’ve been told.”

“Yeah.”

“Do you remember what she said?  What it was about?”

“No.  Not much, anyway.”

I didn’t know how to broach the next question.  It was the one I was really here to ask.

“Did it…  did it have anything to do with what you said to me on the phone?”

“I don’t know what you mean.”

I stopped, took a breath.  I looked at her, making eye contact.  “The thing you said you could only say once.  About a game being played.”

Her face was pale and still.  She swallowed her food, hard, and took a drink to wash it down.  She looked down, then back.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“I think you do.”

She looked around, re-wrapped her sandwich and put it in her bag.  She stood up.  “Walk with me, Ok?”

I looked around, but nodded and stood up.  She walked away from the coffee shop, bag in one hand and cup in the other.  She walked down the sidewalk and turned right, and kept walking.  There was a little park not too far from where we were, she turned toward it.  I walked beside her.

“I don’t know how they know the things they do.  I don’t know that they weren’t watching us there.”

“Who?”

“I don’t know.”

“Well, why do you think they’re watching?”

She shook her head.  “Maybe they aren’t, I don’t know.”  She paused, taking a deep breath.  We were walking in the grass now, toward the park.  She spoke quietly.  “About a year and a half ago, I got a call.  Just a voice on the other end of the phone.  It said I’d be paid… a lot.  Like thousands of dollars.  All I had to do was report back on the things certain patients said.”

“What?”

“I know, it’s a breach of privacy.  I shouldn’t have done it.  But… it was a lot of money for me.  I owed on school loans, had a car payment.  I want to buy a house one day.  And all they wanted was for me to record some things.  Keep a little voice recorder and switch it on around a few patients they’d single out.  They knew names, when patients would arrive.  I didn’t know how.  But at first it was only one every few months, and they paid on time.  All I was recording was just rambling, psychotic babble.  Stuff that no one could care about.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know.  I didn’t ask.”  She turned her face away like she was looking out at the street.  It seemed like she was just looking away from me.  “Then your sister came in.  It was the time before the last one.  They had me record her.  When they got the recordings after I uploaded them, they asked for me to bug her room, to make sure I got everything she said.  I said no, that wasn’t something I was comfortable doing.”

She paused, turning to look over at me.  Her face was afraid.  “The voice on the phone told me things.  Things no one could have known about my life.  Emailed me photographs from when I was a kid, pictures of my family.  They said if I didn’t bug the room, there were things they knew about me.  Things they could do.”  She looked around and took a deep breath.  There was a bench and we sat down on it, the shade making it cool.  She tried to take a drink of her coffee, but had to still her shaking hand.  She looked at me.

“I was scared.  A man came to the hospital the next day and asked about Mallory.  He didn’t look like he should be there.  The front office turned him away because he wasn’t family, but he saw me in the hall and he looked right at me.  Like he knew exactly who I was.  I bought extra voice recorders that night and I taped one under one of the little tables in her room.  I swapped them out when I would go in to check on her, and I kept doing it until she left.”

I didn’t know what to say.  I waited until she gathered herself a little.  She looked around, but there was no one on the sidewalk, no one but two kids in the park, and they were at the far end, just pushing each other on swings.  She drank a little more coffee.

“I asked what the recordings were for, but they wouldn’t say.  They paid me and threatened me at the same time.  But once your sister came in, they didn’t ask for recordings of anyone else.  For about five months after she left, I thought maybe they’d decided it was enough.  I thought maybe it was over.  But then she came in again, that last time.  I started recording as soon as she came in.  I sent them everything she said.”

“Do you have copies?”

She shook her head.  “I did.  I got rid of them.  I didn’t know what they were doing, or why.  I thought it might be dangerous to keep them.”

I sighed in frustration, but nodded.  “Yeah.”

“I don’t guess you have a name, or an address you were mailing them to?”

“Just uploads.  They gave me a new email address to send to every time, just random ones.”  She looked down at her coffee cup, then back at me.  “When you called me, at first I thought you were just some new part of it.  I thought maybe you were working for them.”

“I’m not.”

She nodded.  “I know.  I put that together.”

“Have they contacted you again?”

She shook her head.  “No.  Only to pay me for the final set of recordings.”

I sat there quietly for a few minutes.  “Do you know anything else about them?”

“No.  I don’t.  I don’t want to.”

Both Isabella and now Stephanie, contacted the same way, paid and threatened.  Where Isabella I doubted, Stephanie I wanted to believe, though probably she just sold this kind of scared and shaken better.  “What did you mean on the phone?  When you said there might be a way through.”

“Just that they hadn’t hurt me yet.  That maybe if you kept playing along, maybe they wouldn’t hurt you either.”

I didn’t know how much of that to believe.  I walked back with her to her car, thanked her for talking to me.  Promised I wouldn’t bring it up at work again, since she was obviously frightened.  She thanked me, and she drove away.

That night I dreamed again.  I found myself near the banks of the river that had once warned me from drinking.  I looked down into it but it was silent.  The wood beyond loomed larger than it had before, and whatever certainty and confidence that had come with me across the banks had fled with the draught of the river I had taken.  John was no longer beyond the banks on the other side, and the sun had set.  Night was coming on, and the trees seemed as if they were part of it.  I put the flower from the girl in the button hole of my shirt, and I thought of her sad face as she wept for her brother.  Steeling myself, I walked into the wood.

There was only the most narrow of paths.  The dark pushed in at it, and though, as is the nature of a dream, I could see, my eyes did not penetrate the gloom very far.  Beside me though there was a rustling and a strange noise.  As I walked, it was as if something walked beside me, the crack of broken sticks and the crush of leaves, the sound of breath low and deep.  And then it was silent.  I turned my eyes to the path before me, to try and see.  In the distance and from the black glowed two yellow points.  I was afraid and I began to step backward, but suddenly they rushed toward me, and there was a great wolf standing before me, its mouth open, its eyes burning, its teeth flashing like knives in the dark.  Its back bristled with rage, and its shoulders almost as tall as I stood myself.  It looked down on me.  I could feel the heat of its breath, see the steam of it in the air.  In a low growl, it spoke.

“Give me the flower, tiny man.  Give me the flower, and I will let you live.  Abandon this fool’s errand, seek no more the witch of these woods.”

And I wanted to.  I took the flower into my hand, and I all but extended it to him.  But then it began, ever so softly, to glow.  The wolf growled at the new light, but did not shrink away.

“Give me the flower, or I will rend you limb from limb.  I will tear your flesh from your bones, that the ravens might feast upon it!”

But the flower in my hand seemed to glow as if to say that I must not release it.  At long last I found my voice.  “I will not, dread wolf.  The flower was given to me by a girl, that I might seek the wicked woman of the forest, to find her brother and return him home.”

The wolf roared in rage and laughter.  “Her brother is long dead, his bones ground down to dust!”

“Then I must see the heap of it with my own eyes,” I said, though I trembled at the saying.

And the wolf snarled and leapt upon me, and did just as he had threatened.  He rent my body limb from limb, and tore the flesh from my very bones.  I cried out in agony, but my fingers did not release the flower from their grasp.

It became darker than before, and the wolf stalked away.  I lay as dead, scattered like carrion, waiting for beetles, worms, and crows.  It seemed as if a long time passed.  Then there was the sound of beating wings, and surely as I expected, a raven came and landed near.  Before my bloody lips could speak, it devoured one of my eyes.  I cried out in fresh pain and the raven hopped back, and cocked its head at me.

“Little man, how are you not dead?” it asked.

My mouth worked but slowly, struggling to form words.  “Friend raven, do not eat the rest of me.  My body is broken but I live yet.”

The raven tilted its head from side to side, and it hopped about the space of my undoing, and looked at the bloody mess I had become.  “Little man, I can mend you, but there will be a price.”

My rasping voice answered.  “Name your price, friend, I will pay you what I can.”

The raven hopped toward me.  “I will tell you when we have finished.  But do you swear to pay?”

And seeing no other hope, I answered that I would.  The raven flapped its wings and flew, returning with two clear flasks.  One held a water very dark, and the other a water very light.  The raven gathered my limbs together, and all my bits of flesh, and set them together as they should have been, joint to joint and bone to bone.  At the top he placed my head, and I looked down on my broken body.  The raven then took the flask of very dark water, and poured it over the length of my mutilated flesh.  Slowly my limbs began to rejoin, and my skin began to knit.  Soon I was whole, but I could not move.  The raven then took the flask of very light water and poured it over my body, and much into my mouth.  I coughed and sputtered and was able to sit up.  I moved my arms and my legs and turned my head from side to side.  I laughed and jumped back to my feet.  My right eye was gone from my head, and but for its loss I was whole.

“Thank you, little raven!  Without you I might have slept and never woken!  Now, please tell me, what is your price for having saved my life?”

The raven hopped back and forth, and twisted its head to look up at me.  “My price is small, little man.  You seek the witch of these dark woods, for so I heard the wolf say of man he had just torn asunder.”

“I do.”

“My price is only that I be allowed to guide you, by taking that flower into my beak.  I will fly before you and herald your coming, that you might have a friend for such a conference.”

My heart was heavy in me, for I knew I could not part with the flower.  I held it in my hand, and again it began to glow.  “Friend raven, ask for something else.  You are too kind, and your price too generous, I owe you a great deal more.”

The raven hopped, and it squawked angrily.  “That is my price, which you promised you would pay!”

“But little raven, I cannot do you as you ask, for the flower is not mine to give.  I have promised to find the brother of a broken-hearted girl.  I must bear the flower to the wicked woman of the wood.”

The raven fluttered up and darted toward my only eye.  “Give me the flower, or I will make you blind!”

I shielded my face from the beak and scratching talons, though they bloodied my hands and arms.  I held the flower close and tried to protect my eye.  At long last the raven screamed in frustration, and flew away into the black.

I was alone again on the path.  The flower glowed, but gently now, and I walked forward once more, afraid lest the wolf or the raven return.  I walked for a very long time, until I found myself in a little meadow, surrounded on all sides by trees.  In the meadow there were hundreds of flowers like my own, and at the center lay a lamb.  It was small and its bleating was gentle, and I walked to it.

“Hello little lamb,” I said as I approached.  “This seems a dark and dangerous wood for such a one as you.”

The lamb looked up at me, and its eyes were big and very deep, and it looked calm and quite certain of itself.  It spoke softly in return.  “I do not fear the raven, nor the wolf that roams among the trees.  For I am the creature of the wicked woman, the secret heart of her.”  It looked about at the flowers, and they began one by one to glow.  “She loves me best, and I sit here among this her hidden garden.  You must have come to find her, or you would not be here in this wood.”

“I have, little lamb.  There is a sorrowful girl who has lost her dearest brother, and I have come to take him home.”

The lamb stood, and began to walk, and I followed after it.  It spoke as it took its delicate steps.  “Her brother has been waiting, the old woman has entertained him these many months.  He lost his way in these dark woods, and has no path upon which his feet will wander home.”

I was surprised, and said so to the lamb.  “The wicked woman does not hold him?”

The lamb bleated a laughing reply.  “She holds him not at all, but that he knows not how to leave.”

I laughed with joy, for I had not known how I might effect such a theft and flee.  “Then he might return with me the way I came?”

“He may indeed, if he will go.  Though to find the witch, there is one thing left that you must do.”

“Tell me, little lamb.  I will do this thing.”

“You must let me plant that flower here in my pretty field.  Place the stem between my teeth, and I will scratch a hole and plant it here with all the rest.  It is this that you must do, or the witch will not receive you.”

My little flower began to glow.  The lamb’s eyes were darker now, and behind them was not the gentle thing I saw when first I entered here.  I held my blossom far away.

“Little lamb, I will not do this thing.  I must hold the flower until I find the wicked woman.  I know it is this that I must do.”

“You are wrong, foolish man.  To accomplish your journey you must abandon what has guided you this far.  It is only a new wisdom that can lead you now from here.”

But its eyes were menacing and I did not believe its words.  I held my flower still away, as the lamb drew near me.  It spoke to me quietly, with malice in its flashing eyes.

“I am her secret heart.  I am the creature of the wicked woman.  Your flower will be my flower, whether you will or no.  Give me the flower, and I will plant it.  Only then will you find the witch of these darkened woods.”

I backed away from the lamb, then twisted and ran past it, and into the darkness of the wood beyond.  It did not follow, but now before me there was no path.

I woke up upon looking into the black of a fresh wood beyond the one I had soon passed.  There was the sound of the lamb behind me, and I turned around in my bed, but there was nothing.  I clicked on a light.  A strange thought came to me, and I walked over to my closet, and lifted the white box that Isabella had given me.  I pulled out the glass flower, and held it up, looking at it.  I sat down in a chair and stared at the flower, not sure what to think.
