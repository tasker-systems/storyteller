The place was strange, as if in twilight, but there were flickers of light about the boy, and he could see, though his eyes seemed clouded.  Nothing would hold still, and though he saw plants and creatures before him, they changed and became other, and then back again.  There was a girl in front of him, and she looked at him fondly.  “Who are you?” the boy said.

“I cannot say,” the girl smiled.  “But you will know me, soon.”

“Where is my sister?” the boy asked.  “Is she here?”

The girl nodded sagely.  “She is.  She has been of great service to me, as have you.  But I’m sorry, you will not find her.”

“I will,” the boy said resolutely.  “I have walked for longer than you know.”

“You have walked very far.  But she is farther still, and more than mortal feet can carry on.”

The boy shook his head.  “I do not understand.”

“It is not important that you do,” said the girl.  “But when you wake, you will remember, and one day perhaps you will think of me.”

The girl suddenly grew taller, and she became a woman, tall and pale, with white and shimmering hair.  “Are you a spirit?” the boy asked.

She looked back at him, as she began to turn away.  “No, child.  I am something else.”

When he woke, he had a bandage about his chest, and he was in the home of the woman who had given him the seeds.  The eldest daughter was in a chair beside the bed, reading.  She looked at him as he roused, and she smiled.  “So, you’re awake.”  He looked about the room.  It was nice, a little bed and a chair, a desk with books to one side.  The girl stood from the chair and put her book down, and sat on the bed to touch his forehead.  “Your fever has broken.  That is good.”  He tried to sit up, but there was pain in his chest that made it hard to breathe, and he lay back down.

“Where is my sister?” the boy asked.  “What happened?”

The girl shook her head.  “I don’t know.  Two days ago, a man brought you here, and asked that we watch over you.”

The boy was confused.  “I don’t understand.  I was in the cave… and my sister, and the seeds…  where is the old woman?”

The daughter shook her head.  “There was no old woman that I saw.  Only a man, and he has not returned.”

The boy was silent, and he thought.

Days passed, and his chest began to heal.  The family was very kind to him, and though he did not want to ask, he hoped perhaps he could stay.  He was very tired of traveling.  When his chest was well enough to allow him to leave the house, he walked to the cave, which was not far away.  He took a little lantern, and he descended into the dark.  He found the pool, and footsteps, and a dark spot where he had bled.  He found a blanket, folded neatly.  And he found the plant, unexpectedly growing.  It was small, with a single blossom, and he could not understand how it could grow without the sunlight.  But as days and weeks passed, he continued to return, and water it, and sit beside it, and sometimes, though plants cannot talk back, he would speak to it as if it were his sister.  Sometimes, in the dark and quiet, alone in the lantern light, he thought it silently listened.

And so life continued on, and a year passed, and then another.  He was to the family another son, and they to him a loving home.  He grew older, and though he missed his sister very much, in time he grew accustomed to it.  One day the family was going to the city, and he was old enough now to look after his younger brother, and together they walked through the market, watching people and listening to the bustle of comings and goings.  He enjoyed the sounds more now than he once had, a kind of life in them that was invigorating.  He walked with his brother, up and down market streets, until, all at once, he thought he saw the woman with the white hair.  He ran toward the place, but she passed behind a wall, and the crowd was busy all about him, and he was slowed by holding on to his younger brother’s hand.  They ran together, and he saw a flash of white hair, and a face turned to look at him, rounding yet another corner.  She smiled, and she knew him, and he her, and he ran after her as fast as he could.

He turned the corner, but she was not there.  There was only a quiet space, near a gate in the city wall, and a man there selling flowers.  He had in his cart many blossoms, but among them the boy saw the purple bell shaped blossom of the same flower in his cave.  He ran to the man, pulling his brother along behind.  “Sir, did a woman pass this way?” he gasped.

“No, son.  It has been very quiet near my little cart today.”

“No one at all?” the boy asked, almost frantic.

“No, no one I saw, my boy.  Why?  Are you looking for someone?”

He looked back down the street, and back down into the market square, and finally out the gate, into the fields beyond, but she was nowhere to be seen.  “No, sir.  I suppose not.”

He looked at the flowers on the man’s cart, and he pointed to the purple bell-blossom.  “I will take this flower,” he said.

“Ah, that’s a beautiful one, isn’t it?  Dangerous poison, but beautiful.  Dedicated to a new goddess, too, from what I hear.”

The boy touched the blossom of the flower gently, and reached into his pocket and handed the man a coin.  The man lifted the plant and its little pot, and handed it to the boy.  Hoping perhaps to see the woman, the boy’s eyes searched still over the people in the market.  Almost absently, the boy asked, “What goddess is that?”

The man looked at the boy, who was not looking back, and he smiled a strange smile.  “I believe her name is Vretil.”
