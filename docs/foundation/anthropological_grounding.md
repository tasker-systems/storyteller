# Anthropological Grounding: Mediation, Bodies, and the Shape of Worlds

## On the Roots of the System

The storyteller project did not begin as a software specification. It began in the encounter between narrative craft and a way of thinking about the world shaped by anthropological fieldwork and theory — specifically, by research into the ayahuasca shamanic traditions of the Peruvian and Ecuadorian Amazon and their relationships to exchange networks, embodiment, historical violence, and the mediatory capacities of plants and persons.

This document traces the intellectual genealogy from that academic work into the system's core design concepts. The parallels are not surface analogies. They are structural: the same commitments to layered understanding, reciprocal constitution, embodied knowledge, and mediation between worlds that animate the anthropological inquiry have been transmuted into the architecture of a narrative system. Naming this genealogy serves two purposes. First, it makes visible the philosophical commitments that underpin design decisions that might otherwise appear arbitrary. Second, it provides a touchstone for future decisions — when the system faces a fork, the question "what would be consistent with these commitments?" becomes answerable.

The source material for this document is a master's thesis in Latin American Studies (University of Florida, 2013) on plants, ritual, and mediation in the ayahuasca shamanism of the Napo River, Ucayali River, and Iquitos region. That work is grounded in place and space, layered through history and material reality, engaged ethnographically with living cultural practices, and brought into dialogue with theoretical frameworks from anthropology, religious studies, and phenomenology. Narrative worldbuilding is a different enterprise. But the shared structure of layered inquiry — and the shared insistence that material conditions, social forms, spiritual expressions, and aesthetic practices are reciprocally constitutive — makes the one illuminating for the other.

A necessary caveat: the anthropological work describes real people, real suffering, real cultural practices with deep historical roots. The storyteller system draws architectural inspiration from the structural relationships identified in that work. This is not a claim that building a narrative system is equivalent to the lived realities of indigenous and mestizo communities in Amazonia. It is a claim that careful attention to how worlds actually cohere — how material conditions produce cultural forms that reshape material conditions in return — produces better system design than starting from abstract first principles alone.

## The Method: Layered Worldbuilding as Mutual Production

The thesis builds understanding through progressive layering that mirrors the mutual production principle articulated in the system's world design philosophy.

**Layer 1: Geography and Place.** The investigation begins with rivers — the Napo flowing from the Andean foothills toward Iquitos, the Ucayali rising from the Urubamba and flowing north to join the Amazon. Rivers define the region not abstractly but materially: they determine what trade is possible, what contact occurs, what diseases travel, what political control can be exercised. The rivers are the ground from which everything else grows.

**Layer 2: Material-Political History.** Exchange networks predate European contact by centuries. The Conibo controlled river passage and traded captives for iron tools. The Piro maintained Andean trade contacts reaching to Cuzco. The Runa's predecessors brokered between highland and lowland worlds. These networks carried not only material goods but ritual knowledge — Langdon's insight that "ritual material, knowledge, and power should be understood within the context of broader systems of exchange, treating these as 'trade items'" (1981:112) is foundational. Disease, missionization, and the rubber economy shattered and reconstituted these networks, but the pattern of exchange persisted.

**Layer 3: Cultural and Ritual Forms.** The ayahuasca shamanic complex — its beliefs, practices, songs, and healing traditions — grew from these exchange networks, not despite colonial disruption but through it. The Runa's position as cultural mediators between white and indigenous worlds gave them cultural capital that extended to their ritual traditions. The mestizo shamans of Iquitos incorporated Catholic liturgical elements, European esoteric thought, and even biomedical imagery into their practice without internal incoherence — because the tradition's defining characteristic is mediation between worlds, and new worlds simply provide new material to mediate.

**Layer 4: Embodied Experience.** The thesis culminates in the body — the site where all forces (political, economic, historical, spiritual, ecological) intersect and manifest. The suffering body of the patient and the transformational body of the shaman meet in ritual space, where healing occurs not through the transcendence of material conditions but through their reorientation at the site of the flesh.

This layering is not merely expository sequence. Each layer reshapes the others. The rivers are not just geography once you understand they are also cosmological pathways — the *yacuruna* (water people) inhabit the world beneath the waters, making rivers simultaneously material trade routes and boundaries between worlds. Disease is not just biology once you understand that mission *reducciones* concentrated indigenous bodies specifically to make them controllable, and this concentration amplified contagion. Ritual knowledge is not just cultural expression once you understand it travels the same networks as salt and iron tools, and that the groups who elaborate it most richly are the same groups positioned as political-economic brokers.

### System Implication: The Mutual Production Principle

This layered method is the direct source of the system's coherence principle: "material conditions and social forms exist in a relationship of mutual production." The system's world design philosophy — that the economy and the prayers and the weather and the politics grow from the same soil — is not a metaphor borrowed from Marx alone. It is an empirical observation from ethnographic research: in Amazonia, the rivers that carry trade also carry cosmological meaning, and the groups that control trade passages also control access to spiritual power. The system must model worlds in which this kind of reciprocal constitution is the norm, not the exception.

The five authorial ingress points (relational web, narrative graph, single scene, aesthetic expression, material condition) reflect this layered method. Each is a valid starting point because each layer implies the others. A story designer who begins with a material condition (the thin soil, the long winters) will find that relationships, narrative structure, aesthetic register, and scene texture all follow as implications — just as the thesis's geographic starting point implies the exchange networks, which imply the ritual complex, which implies the healing body.

## Mediation as Spectrum: Contact, Translation, Transport

The thesis identifies three modes of mediation between worlds, each associated with a specific plant and a specific degree of boundary permeability:

**Tobacco — Contact.** Tobacco establishes and maintains relationships between the human world and the spirit world. Smoke materializes breath, making the shaman's life-force visible and tangible. Tobacco "invites and feeds the spirits," "purifies and protects the body," and "nurtures the magical phlegm" (Beyer 2009:267). Its effects are largely predictable, relatively short-lived, and not life-threatening. It is the plant of ongoing relationship — low friction, high reliability, biographical timescale.

**Ayahuasca — Translation.** Ayahuasca allows the ritual specialist to maintain presence in multiple worlds simultaneously. Its defining phenomenological characteristic is lucidity — "no sense of being narcotized, no decrease in alertness, no inability to process linearly" (Beyer 2009:232). The shaman can engage fully with the spirit world while remaining cognizant and capable in the human world. This "foot in both worlds" quality makes ayahuasca particularly suited to healing, because the power drawn from the spirit world can be applied to the suffering body without the healer losing contact with the patient. The Desana myth states that "mankind needed a means of communication; it was for that reason that the Sun Father was searching for Yaje" (Calavia Saéz 2011:134).

**Datura — Transport.** Datura sends the seeker wholly into another world. The human world is no longer available during the experience. Knowledge and power may be gained, but at the risk of death — the spirits themselves warn that "no one has the power to live in the *unai* where you are now" (Whitten 2008:87). Datura collapses space and time such that the seeker becomes aware of "all the spirits" (Whitten 1976:153), but this total permeability between worlds is dangerous precisely because it dissolves the boundaries that make the human world habitable.

### System Implication: The Communicability Gradient

This three-fold spectrum is the direct ancestor of the system's entity communicability gradient. The four dimensions of communicability — surface area, friction of translation, timescale, and ability to turn toward — formalize what the mediation spectrum describes ethnographically.

Tobacco's mode of contact is high surface area, low friction, biographical timescale, reliable reciprocity — like a Character in the system's entity spectrum, fully available for narrative exchange. Datura's mode of transport is total surface area but overwhelming, no translation friction because there is no translation (you *become* the other world), collapsed timescale — like the system's concept of a Condition that is so pervasive it restructures everything it touches. Ayahuasca's mode of translation is the generative middle — partial surface area, managed friction, dual timescale (both worlds simultaneously) — like a Presence in the system, something with substantial communicability that requires the World Agent's translation to participate in the narrative.

The system's commitment to a gradient rather than a binary (agent vs. prop, character vs. setting) comes directly from the anthropological observation that mediation exists on a spectrum. The Runa do not divide their world into "minded beings" and "inert matter." They recognize that different plants, different spirits, different places have different degrees and qualities of communicability, different timescales of engagement, different capacities for reciprocal relationship. The system should model worlds with the same nuance.

## The Body as Nexus: Character Tensors and the Site of Intersection

The thesis argues that the body is the site where all constitutive forces — political, economic, historical, spiritual, ecological — intersect and manifest. The suffering body is simultaneously *produced by* and *afflicted by* these forces. Healing occurs not by escaping material conditions but by reorienting their arrangement at the site of the body.

This argument has a precise structural parallel in the character tensor model.

### The Geological Temporal Model as Inscribed History

The thesis describes how colonial violence becomes "historical sorcery" — buried in the earth, rising again as the same *samai* (vital energy, life-breath) that carries both life-force and the capacity for harm. For the Runa, history "is visible everywhere in the landscape" (Kohn 2007:125), and the body shares an identity with the *allpa* (earth) from which it is sustained. The past "blossoms into the present, which in the passage of time becomes again the ground of the future" (Uzendoski et al. 2012:15). Bodies are born from, live on, and return to the same earth in continuous cycles.

The geological temporal model — bedrock, sediment, topsoil — is this argument rendered as data structure:

- **Bedrock** is the character's historical sorcery: the foundational traumas and joys formed before the character had language to question them, extraordinarily resistant to change, grooves worn so deep by time that experience flows along them automatically. A character raised in poverty hoards resources long after becoming wealthy. A character abandoned in childhood sabotages intimacy in adulthood. These are the colonial histories inscribed in the body — not literally colonial for most fictional characters, but the same structural relationship between historical force and present behavior.

- **Sediment** is the character's sustained patterns of social and material experience: the distrust built over years of betrayal, the warmth built over years of love. Sediment resists change but is not immutable — a single act of kindness does not dissolve years of betrayal, just as a single benevolent policy does not undo centuries of exploitation. But sustained counter-pressure can reshape sediment over time.

- **Topsoil** is the character's immediate experience: volatile, responsive, easily shaped. Today's anger may be tomorrow's regret. Topsoil is weather; sediment and bedrock are climate.

### The Echo Phenomenon as Historical Trauma

The echo mechanism — old emotional states reactivated by current experiences that map onto historical ones with sufficient similarity — is the character-level expression of "historical sorcery." The Runa understand that the figure of Jumandy, who led an indigenous assault on the Spanish in 1578, is not merely a historical symbol invoked during the 2001 *levantamiento* against dollarization. He is an ancestor present in the same earth, the same bodies, who have grown and lived and died and been reborn from the same *allpa*. The violence of 1578 and the violence of 2001 are not merely analogous — they resonate through the same soil.

When a character in the system does something that seems disproportionate or unexpected, and we understand a beat later that it was not about *this* situation at all — it was about something older, deeper, unresolved — this is the echo phenomenon. And the echo phenomenon is historical sorcery at the scale of a single life: the past rising through the present, carried on the same breath.

### Context-Dependent Activation as the Shaman's Selective Vision

The thesis describes how ayahuasca allows the shaman to perceive specific aspects of the spirit world relevant to the current healing — not all spirits at once (that is Datura's overwhelming totality) but the particular spirits, plants, and forces relevant to this patient's suffering. The Shipibo-Conibo shaman's visionary "books" of luminous designs are selectively accessed based on the needs of the ritual moment.

Context-dependent activation in the character tensor model works the same way. The Character Agent does not receive the full tensor (that would be Datura — overwhelming, unsorted, dangerous). It receives a contextually activated subset — the dimensions that matter right now, weighted by current relevance. This is ayahuasca's mode: selective, lucid, maintaining connection to both the character's full depth and the scene's immediate demands.

## Exchange Networks and the Relational Web

The indigenous exchange networks of the Napo and Ucayali — where material goods, ritual knowledge, political relationships, and human bodies all flowed along the same river routes — are structurally identical to the system's relational web.

Both systems share key properties:

**Asymmetry is the default.** The Conibo's view of their relationship with the Franciscans (a source of iron tools to be manipulated) differs from the Franciscans' view (souls to be saved, territory to be controlled). The Piro's trading relationships with Andean groups position them differently than the Conibo's warfare-based extraction from smaller neighbors. In the relational web, A's view of the relationship with B differs from B's view, and both may differ from reality.

**The same channel carries multiple kinds of exchange.** Salt, iron tools, ritual knowledge, captive bodies, political alliances, shamanic power — these all traveled the same river networks. In the relational web, trust, affection, debt, power, history, and projection all exist along the same relational edge. The system models this multiplicity because the anthropological evidence shows that human relationships are never single-channel.

**Position in the network generates capacity.** The Runa's position as brokers between highland and lowland worlds gave them cultural capital that extended to the perceived potency of their ritual traditions. Their relational position — not their intrinsic qualities alone — made them powerful. In the system, a character's position in the relational web (who trusts them, who owes them, who fears them) generates narrative possibility that goes beyond their individual tensor.

**Debt is the plot engine.** The thesis describes how obligation, reciprocity, and the failure of reciprocity drive both exchange and conflict. The Conibo's ambivalent relationship with the Jesuits — sometimes trading, sometimes killing — was structured by the economy of access to iron tools. The *pusanga* (love magic) of Iquitos operates in a world where desire is bound up with economic survival. In the relational web case study, debt was identified as the primary plot engine for "The Fair and the Dead" — and this is no accident.

### System Implication: Projection as Dramatic Irony

The relational web's *projection* dimension — what one character assumes about another, which may differ significantly from reality — has its anthropological source in the thesis's account of how colonial powers projected "tamed savagery" onto indigenous healers, creating a quasi-psychoanalytic transference in which the figure of the "Indian" becomes the means by which the colonizer seeks release from civilization. The Shipibo-Conibo who "do not agree with the 'ayahuasca-shaman' identity concept that has been collectively imposed on them" (Brabec de Mori 2011:44) are living inside someone else's projection.

In the system, projection is the primary source of dramatic irony. What a character *assumes* about another — the idealized mentor, the demonized rival, the underestimated sibling — structures their behavior in ways that create tension when the projection meets reality. This is not a mechanical game design concept. It is the anthropological observation that relationships are always mediated by what each party imagines about the other, and that these imaginations have real consequences.

## Montage and the Narrator: Healing Through Juxtaposition

The thesis argues, following Taussig, that healing in the ayahuasca ritual space works through *montage* — the juxtaposition of images, sounds, and references from radically different domains (political, historical, spiritual, ecological, corporeal) in a way that does not resolve into a single coherent meaning but rather opens space for the reorientation of forces. The shaman does not explain the patient's suffering. The shaman creates a "synesthetic cacophony of perfumes, tobacco smoke, whispering, whistling, blowing, singing, sucking, gagging, the insistent shaking of shacapa leaves" (Beyer 2009:22-23) that draws from multiple worlds to act on the body.

The *icaros* — the healing songs — are particularly illuminating. They often contain words from languages unknown to the patients, phonemes that mimic but do not constitute semantic content, sounds that bypass meaning to register as transformational power. Csordas's analysis of glossolalia applies: these utterances "rupture the world of human meaning, like a wedge forcing an opening in discourse and creating the possibility of creative cultural change" (1988:24). The song is a path between shaman and spirit, not a message with fixed content.

### System Implication: The Narrator's Aesthetic Register

The Narrator is the system's shaman. Not metaphorically — structurally. The Narrator takes fragments of knowledge from different agents (the Storykeeper's filtered revelations, the Character Agents' expressed intentions, the World Agent's translated conditions, the Reconciler's sequenced interactions) and assembles them into prose that the player experiences as a coherent world. This assembly is montage. The Narrator juxtaposes the weight of the ale with the wary way the innkeeper speaks of the lord with the shrine tucked behind the woodpile — fragments from different "worlds" of the system's knowledge — to create an experience that is more than the sum of its information.

The thesis's account of the *icaro* suggests something important about the Narrator's aesthetic register. The most powerful moments in narrative prose — like the most powerful moments in healing song — are not the ones that convey the most information. They are the ones that bypass semantic content to register at the level of rhythm, image, and sensation. The Narrator must be capable of this register: prose that works on the reader not through exposition but through the weight and texture of language itself. This is what the foundation documents mean by "aesthetic expression" as an authorial ingress point — the poem about ghost refugees is not a plot point or a relationship. It is an *icaro*: a sound that opens a world.

## The Shaman's Position and the World Agent: Translation Between Worlds

For the Runa, the crossing of thresholds and boundaries — mediating between worlds — is the defining position of the shaman (Whitten 2008:61). The shaman's power comes not from control over either world but from the capacity to translate between them. The *banco* (seat of the spirits) is simultaneously present in the human world (seated, grounded, unmoveable) and in the spirit world (inhabited by other intentionalities, singing with voices not his own). The shaman does not control the spirits. The shaman makes their power available to the human world, and in doing so, submits to their presence in his body.

### System Implication: The World Agent as Translator

The World Agent's role in the system — not constraint enforcer but translator for the non-character world — is the shaman's position applied to the relationship between the world's own mode of being and the narrative's mode of being.

When the World Agent reports that the stream is running high after three days of rain, it is doing what the shaman does: translating the stream's current state (its swollen urgency, its indifference to human plans, its relationship to the weather that fed it) into a form that the Narrator can render and the other agents can reason about. The World Agent does not control the stream. It makes the stream's communicability available to the narrative.

This reframing has a specific consequence: the World Agent should not be a pure rules engine. It should have something of the shaman's capacity for translation — the ability to render the world's non-character entities (weather, geography, economy, ecology) not as database entries but as presences with their own modes of communication, their own timescales, their own ways of participating in the story. The mountain does not speak. But the World Agent can translate its walking.

## The Body-as-Swarm and the Character Agent

The thesis describes the shaman as a "collective being" — a person composed of spirits, darts, and intentionalities that inhabit the shaman's body. The Shuar shaman's *tsentsak* (spirit darts) are "autonomous, alive, spirits, sometimes with their own needs and desires, including a desire to kill" (Beyer 2009:98). The *banco* is a "seat of the spirits" where the human shaman, the possessing spirit, and the spirit-darts all come together at the same site of ritual power. The shaman is a multiplicity — "more an aggregation of spirits, persons, wills, intentions, and forces than a single unitary consciousness."

This has a precise structural parallel in the Character Agent's relationship to its tensor. The Character Agent is not a unitary consciousness consulting a personality profile. It is a performance emerging from the interplay of multiple dimensions — personality axes that may contradict each other, motivational layers (surface/deep/shadow) that may work at cross purposes, relational pressures that pull in different directions, temporal layers that carry the weight of different histories. The quality of character performance depends on the agent's ability to hold these multiplicities in tension — to feel the contradiction between loyalty and resentment, to let a buried fear color an ostensibly confident action.

The thesis's shaman-as-swarm also illuminates the Reconciler's function. In a multi-character scene, multiple Character Agents each bring their own multiplicities. The Reconciler sequences these overlapping swarms of intention and contradiction — not adding content but structuring what the Character Agents express, surfacing the dramatic potential in their intersection. This is the ritual space itself: the site where the swarm of the shaman intersects with the multiple-body of the patient.

## What This Means for What We Build

The anthropological grounding does not prescribe specific implementation decisions. It provides a set of commitments that should inform decisions when the system faces a fork:

**When modeling entities, prefer gradients over binaries.** The Runa do not divide their world into "minded" and "inert." Neither should the system. The communicability gradient — character, presence, condition, prop — is more faithful to the anthropological reality of how people relate to their worlds than any binary classification.

**When modeling characters, remember that the body is the nexus.** The tensor is not a personality profile. It is the site where history, relationship, material circumstance, and immediate experience all intersect. Context-dependent activation is not a performance optimization. It is the recognition that different aspects of a person become foregrounded in different situations — the selective vision of the ayahuasca experience, not the overwhelming totality of Datura.

**When modeling relationships, expect asymmetry and multiplicity.** The same channel carries trust, debt, power, and projection. Position in the network generates capacity. And what one party imagines about the other is as consequential as what is "true."

**When designing the Narrator, aim for montage, not exposition.** The most powerful moments in narrative — like the most powerful moments in healing — work through juxtaposition, rhythm, and image, not through the delivery of information. The Narrator should be capable of prose that works on the reader the way an *icaro* works on a patient: not by explaining but by opening.

**When designing the World Agent, build a translator, not a referee.** The world's non-character entities participate in the story not as constraints but as presences with their own modes of communicability. The World Agent's job is to make that communicability available to the narrative, translating the mountain's walking into something the Narrator can render and the player can feel.

**When facing a fork, follow the mutual production principle.** If a design choice produces elements that are consistent but not coherent — that do not imply one another, that feel like separate databases rather than aspects of a single world — reconsider. The anthropological evidence consistently shows that the most generative creative systems are the ones in which material conditions, social forms, spiritual expressions, and aesthetic practices grow from the same soil.
