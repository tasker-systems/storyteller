# World Design: Coherence, Craft, and the Shape of the Real

## On the Coherence of Worlds

A world is not a setting. A setting is a backdrop — the painted flat behind the actors, adequate for establishing place and time, disposable when the scene changes. A world is something else. A world is a system of relationships between material conditions and the lives lived within them, where the economy and the prayers and the weather and the politics and the music and the violence all grow from the same soil, not because one mechanically produces the others but because they exist in a state of mutual implication.

The difference matters for what we are building. A storytelling system that treats the world as a database of facts — geography here, politics there, religion in the next field — will produce experiences that feel like stage sets. The player walks through a medieval town and finds a blacksmith, a tavern, a church, a castle. Each is correct. None implies the others. The world is consistent but not coherent.

Coherence is the quality we are after. A coherent world is one in which you can feel that the tavern serves the drink it does because of the crops that grow in this climate, and the crops grow because of the land tenure system, and the land tenure system reflects the political settlement after the last war, and the last war was fought over the pass through the mountains, and the mountains are where the old gods lived before the new faith pushed them to the margins. You do not need to *know* all of this. You need to *feel* it — in the weight of the ale, in the wary way the innkeeper speaks of the lord, in the shrine tucked behind the woodpile that no one mentions.

This is what the best fiction does. It is what the best GMs do. It is what our system must enable story designers to do, and what our agents must be capable of maintaining once a world is set in motion.

## The Mutual Production of Conditions and Forms

Marx wrote that people make their own history, but not in circumstances of their choosing. We have already adopted this as a founding tension — agency within structure, creativity within constraint. But the insight extends beyond individual characters into the shape of worlds.

There is a long and contentious intellectual history around the relationship between material conditions — how a society feeds, houses, defends, and reproduces itself — and the social, spiritual, aesthetic, and moral forms that arise within it. The reductive reading says that the material base *produces* the superstructure: the economy determines the religion, the mode of production determines the art. This reading is mechanical, deterministic, and wrong — not because the relationship doesn't exist, but because the causation is not one-directional.

The more generous and more accurate reading is that material conditions and social forms exist in a relationship of **mutual production**. The feudal economy shapes the faith, yes — a society of lords and peasants tends to produce a religion that sacralizes hierarchy. But the faith also shapes the economy: the monastery becomes a center of agricultural innovation, the church calendar structures the planting cycle, the concept of divine right constrains what political challenges are thinkable. Neither is the base. Neither is the superstructure. They are intertwined root systems, each feeding and constraining the other, producing together a world that feels *of a piece* because it is.

For worldbuilding, this means:

**Every significant element of a world exists in relationship with other elements.** The magic system is not independent of the political system. If magic is rare and powerful, those who wield it accumulate political power, and the political structure adapts — perhaps by incorporating mages into the ruling class, perhaps by suppressing them, perhaps by institutionalizing them into a controlled priesthood. Each of these responses creates a different world with different stories possible within it.

**Material conditions create the ground from which culture grows.** A fishing village on a rocky coast produces different songs, different prayers, different fears, and different heroes than a farming community in a river valley. Not because the geography *determines* the culture — there is always creative surplus, always the irreducible spark of human invention that exceeds its conditions — but because culture is a response to the experience of living, and living happens in material circumstances.

**Social forms reshape material conditions in return.** The songs become work songs that pace the labor. The prayers invoke protection that shapes how risk is assessed. The heroes model behavior that changes what is attempted. The stories told to children shape what those children imagine is possible, which shapes what they build, which reshapes the material conditions for the next generation.

**Coherence emerges from this reciprocity, not from planning.** A story designer who fills in a world by independently specifying geography, then economy, then politics, then religion, then culture will produce something that may be consistent (no contradictions) but will not feel coherent (mutually implying). A story designer who begins with a single thread — the fishing village, the rocky coast, the song sung against the storm — and follows its implications, asking at each step "what else would be true in a world where this is true?", will produce coherence without needing to specify everything.

## Authorial Ingress Points

There is no single correct way to begin building a world or a story. Different designers will find different starting points generative, and the same designer may begin from different places for different projects. The system must support all of them.

We identify at least five distinct ingress points, each with its own character:

### 1. The Relational Web

Begin with people. Who are they to each other? What do they owe, fear, love, resent? The world emerges from the social fabric — if two characters are rivals for a throne, the world must contain a throne worth fighting for, and the political system that makes rivalry possible, and the cultural norms that shape how rivalry is expressed.

This ingress point is natural for designers who think in terms of character and relationship. It produces worlds that are socially rich and emotionally grounded. The risk is a world that feels like a stage for its characters rather than a place that would exist without them.

**What the system requires**: Tools for building character tensors and relational webs first, with the world emerging as the necessary context for those relationships.

### 2. The Narrative Graph

Begin with plot. What are the pivotal moments? What must happen, and in what order? The world emerges as the terrain through which the story moves — if the climax requires a siege, the world must contain fortifications, armies, and the political conditions that make siege warfare thinkable.

This ingress point is natural for designers who think in terms of structure and event. It produces worlds that are dramatically efficient — everything serves the story. The risk is a world that feels engineered for its plot, where you can see the scaffolding.

**What the system requires**: Tools for sketching narrative graphs — scenes, masses, gates, attractor basins — with the world filling in around the structural requirements.

### 3. The Single Scene

Begin with a moment. One encounter, rendered in full — the sounds, the smells, the light, the weight of what is said and unsaid. The world emerges outward from this seed, as the designer asks: what kind of world produces this moment? What must be true about the history, the politics, the landscape, for this scene to feel inevitable rather than arbitrary?

This ingress point is natural for designers who think in terms of texture and immediate experience — who know the feel of a world before they know its map. It produces worlds with extraordinary local depth, scenes that breathe. The risk is a world that is rich in pockets and thin between them — though for a well-designed story, this may be a virtue rather than a fault. Not all territory needs to be mapped at the same resolution.

**What the system requires**: Tools for building outward from a scene — specifying the moment and then discovering its implications for the wider world.

### 4. The Aesthetic Expression

Begin with a feeling, an image, a poem. Not a scene with characters and action but an evocation of what the world *is* — its emotional signature, its aesthetic register, the quality of light and grief and wonder that defines it. Consider:

> *Where did you flee from*
> *How can ghosts be made refugees*
> *What chased you from the hallowed graveyards*
> *Of home*

This is not a plot point. It is not a character relationship. It is not a scene. It is a *question asked in the voice of the world* — and it contains, implicitly, an entire cosmology: a world where the dead can be displaced, where violence in the waking world scatters even ghosts, where home is something the dead can lose, where meaning must be made again in unknown lands.

This ingress point is natural for designers who think in terms of mood, theme, and emotional truth — who know how a world *feels* before they know what happens in it. It produces worlds with strong tonal identity and thematic coherence. The risk is a world that is atmospherically rich but narratively underspecified — though the atmosphere itself may be the most generative thing a designer can offer the system's agents.

**What the system requires**: Tools that translate aesthetic intent into world properties — tone, thematic register, emotional palette — without requiring structural specificity upfront.

### 5. The Material Condition

Begin with the ground. What does the land look like? What grows? Who owns it? How is labor organized? What can be made, and who makes it? The world emerges upward from material reality — the economy shapes the politics shapes the religion shapes the stories people tell themselves about who they are.

This ingress point is natural for designers who think in terms of systems, history, and the texture of daily life. It produces worlds that feel grounded and lived-in, where you can taste the bread and feel the mud. The risk is a world that is sociologically convincing but emotionally inert — a world that is *about* conditions rather than *alive with* the people who inhabit them.

**What the system requires**: Tools for specifying material conditions and tracing their implications — what grows here? who controls it? what does that mean for the people who live here?

### The Ingress Points in Combination

No serious worldbuilding effort uses a single ingress point in isolation. A designer may begin with a feeling (aesthetic) and immediately find themselves thinking about who would live in this world (relational) and what happened to make it this way (material). The ingress points are not stages in a process but orientations of attention — places to begin and return to, each illuminating different aspects of the whole.

The system should support fluid movement between them. A designer building a character's tensor should be able to ask "what world produced this person?" and receive scaffolding for material conditions. A designer sketching a narrative graph should be able to ask "what does this place feel like?" and receive aesthetic prompts. The ingress points are not separate tools but lenses on the same underlying world model.

## What Coherence Is Not

To prevent misunderstanding:

**Coherence is not determinism.** A coherent world does not mechanically produce its inhabitants. People surprise. Cultures innovate. Art exceeds its conditions. The fishing village on the rocky coast may produce, against all apparent logic, a great philosopher whose ideas have nothing to do with fish or storms. Coherence means that this philosopher's existence is *intelligible* — we can see how a childhood spent watching the sea's patterns might produce a mind drawn to abstraction — without being *predictable*.

**Coherence is not completeness.** A coherent world does not need to have every element specified. In fact, overspecification can *damage* coherence by leaving no room for implication. If the designer specifies that the village has exactly three farms, two shops, and one temple, the world feels like an inventory. If the designer specifies that the soil is thin, the winters are long, and the temple door is always open because the priest knows that warmth is a form of prayer, the world feels real — and the player's imagination fills in the rest.

**Coherence is not homogeneity.** A coherent world contains contradictions, tensions, and anomalies. The feudal lord who patronizes artists while taxing his peasants into starvation is not incoherent — he is a specific kind of person that specific kinds of systems produce. The faith that preaches humility from golden altars is not incoherent — it is a faith in tension with itself, and that tension is generative. Coherence means that even the contradictions make sense.

**Coherence is not genre conformity.** A coherent world is not one that perfectly matches genre expectations. It is one that establishes its own rules and follows them. A fantasy world where magic is industrial — where spells are mass-produced in factories and mages are unionized — is coherent if the implications are followed: what does industrialized magic do to the economy, the class structure, the practice of faith, the experience of wonder? The answer may look nothing like standard fantasy, and that is fine.

## Guideposts for Simplification

We cannot model the whole world. The system must make choices about what to represent explicitly, what to leave implicit, and what to ignore. These choices are not neutral — what we model shapes what stories are possible, and what we leave out closes doors. The following guideposts help us make these choices intentionally:

### 1. Model What the Story Touches

The system should represent, at the highest resolution, the elements of the world that the story actually engages. If the story concerns a family's struggle against feudal oppression, the feudal system must be modeled in detail — the obligations, the violence, the legal structures, the daily experience of subjection. The monetary policy of the distant empire can be a single sentence.

This is the tiered detail principle from the Persistent World discussion, extended to all aspects of the world: resolution follows narrative significance.

### 2. Model Relationships, Not Inventories

It is more useful to know that "the thin soil and long winters make every harvest precarious, which is why the temple door is always open" than to know the exact acreage of farmland and the caloric output per season. The system should represent the *relationships* between world elements — how they constrain and enable each other — rather than accumulating isolated facts.

### 3. Let Implication Do the Work

A well-specified relationship implies a hundred unspecified facts. If the designer tells us that "the lord controls the only bridge across the river, and charges tolls that the farmers cannot afford," we can infer the economic stratification, the spatial politics, the resentment, the black market, the songs sung about crossing the river at night. The system should be designed to reason from implications rather than requiring exhaustive specification.

### 4. Preserve Room for Emergence

If every element of the world is specified, there is no room for the agents to discover anything. The Narrator cannot notice that the air smells of woodsmoke and longing if the designer has already specified every smell. The Character Agent cannot be surprised by its own reaction if every reaction is predetermined by the tensor. Leave gaps. The gaps are where the life is.

### 5. When in Doubt, Follow the Material

When the designer has not specified something and the system must infer, the most reliable foundation is material conditions. If we know the climate, the geography, the economy, and the political structure, we can infer a great deal about the culture, the faith, the aesthetic sensibility, and the social norms — not deterministically, but plausibly. Material conditions are the most stable ground from which to reason about the unspecified.

This is not because the material base is more "real" than the cultural superstructure. It is because material conditions are more *constrained* — there are fewer ways to feed a village in a mountain valley than there are ways to worship, and the constraints on feeding narrow the range of plausible worship without determining it. Starting from the more constrained and reasoning toward the less constrained produces more reliable inferences than the reverse.

## The Relationship to Character and Narrative

### Character as World Embodied

The geological metaphor in our character modeling — bedrock, sediment, topsoil — is not just a description of individual psychology. It is a description of how the world inscribes itself into persons.

A character's bedrock is not formed in a vacuum. It is formed in a world — a world with specific material conditions, specific social norms, specific patterns of power and vulnerability. Sarah's bedrock trait of "identity as someone who acts" was not formed abstractly. It was formed on a small farm, in a family where work is how love is expressed, in a world where the strong-backed and the practical survive. Her mother's otherworldliness was possible because the streams were borderlands — a material fact (water is liminal in this world's physics) that created the conditions for a specific kind of spiritual practice.

When the system constructs a character's tensor, it should be informed by the world the character inhabits. Not determined by it — Sarah is not *merely* a product of her conditions. But rooted in it. A character who feels disconnected from their world is either an anomaly (which should be marked and explored) or a failure of coherence (which should be corrected).

### Narrative as the Movement of Conditions

The narrative graph is not an abstract structure floating above the world. It is the world in motion. High-mass scenes have gravitational pull because they are moments where conditions *change* — where the material, social, or spiritual fabric of the world shifts in ways that cannot be undone. A betrayal is high-mass not because it is dramatically intense but because it *restructures the relational and political conditions* in which the characters live.

The mutual production principle applies to narrative as well: events reshape conditions, and conditions reshape what events are possible. The boy whose instruments were sold during hard times is not a victim of "bad luck." He is a victim of a specific set of material conditions — a feudal lord who refused his obligations, a war that conscripted his brothers, an economy that left no surplus for beauty. And his loss of music is itself a condition that shapes what happens next: a village without its minstrel is a quieter, more controlled, less wonderous place.

When the system's agents reason about narrative — about what should happen next, about what consequences flow from player action, about what the world feels like after an event — they should reason in terms of conditions and their transformation, not just in terms of plot and character.

## The Communicability of Things

The world contains mountains, rivers, forests, swords, buildings, weather, economies, plagues, songs, and roads. None of these are characters. The default modeling approach — inherited from game design, reinforced by database architecture — offers a binary: either grant an entity agency (make it character-like, give it a tensor, let it speak) or treat it as inert data (a row in a table, a property of the scene, a constraint on movement). This binary is familiar, intuitive, and wrong.

It is wrong not because mountains are secretly minded — we are not making that claim — but because the binary obscures something important about the relationship between entities and the beings who encounter them. A mountain is not inert. It communicates: through the paths it offers, the weather it generates, the soil it creates downslope, the shelter it provides, the fear it inspires in those who must cross it, the stories told about what lives at the summit. Its communicability is vast — arguably vaster than any character's — but it operates on geological time, through material transformation, with enormous friction of translation between its mode of being and ours.

Dogen wrote in the Mountains and Rivers Sutra that the mountain walks. This is not metaphor or mysticism. It is a precise observation about timescale and attention. What appears static is in motion on its own terms. The mountain's walking is its erosion, its uplift, its reshaping of the watershed, its slow migration of soil and stone. We do not perceive this walking because our attention operates on biographical time. But the mountain's motion is real, and it shapes the world — including the lives lived within it — as profoundly as any character's actions.

### The Gradient

Rather than the binary of agent and prop, we propose a gradient with several dimensions:

**Surface area of communicability** — how much of an entity's nature is available for exchange. A person has enormous surface area: language, gesture, expression, action, silence. A river has less but still substantial: its speed, its depth, its temperature, the sound it makes, the things it carries, the way it shapes the land. A stone has narrow surface area — but in the right context (a hearthstone, a boundary marker, a thrown weapon), it communicates volumes.

**Friction of translation** — the difficulty of rendering an entity's mode of being into the narrative's register. A character's feelings translate into dialogue and action with relatively low friction. A forest's character translates with more friction — the Narrator must find the language for how it feels to walk beneath a canopy that has stood for centuries, to breathe air that tastes of mulch and patience. An economy's condition translates with the highest friction — it must be rendered through its effects on people, through prices and scarcity and the expression on the merchant's face.

**Timescale** — the temporal register in which an entity operates. A flame communicates on the scale of minutes. A person on the scale of years. A river on centuries. A mountain on millennia. An entity's timescale shapes how it participates in the story — a flame is volatile, responsive, dangerous in the immediate; a mountain is reliable, shaping, dangerous in the geological. The system should not flatten these timescales into a single temporal frame.

**Willingness or ability to turn toward** — the capacity for what Buber called the I/Thou encounter, for reciprocal engagement. A person can turn toward you fully. An animal can turn toward you partially — with attention, with responsiveness, but without language's precision. A river turns toward everything in its path equally, without discrimination. A door turns toward whoever pushes it. This dimension is not a measure of consciousness but of the quality of encounter available — and it matters for how the narrative renders the entity's presence.

### What This Means for the System

Not all entities need tensors. Not all entities need tracking. The guideposts for simplification still apply — model what the story touches, model relationships not inventories. But the modeling framework itself should support this gradient rather than forcing a binary classification.

In practice, this suggests a spectrum of entity representation:

**Characters** (full tensor, relational web, temporal dynamics) — entities with rich communicability, low translation friction, biographical timescale, full capacity to turn toward. These are modeled by Character Agents.

**Presences** (partial representation, environmental state, narrative weight) — entities with substantial communicability but higher translation friction or different timescale. The Shadowed Wood in "The Fair and the Dead" is a presence: it has mood, it responds to events (darkening as Sarah ventures deeper), it communicates through atmosphere and obstruction. It does not need a tensor, but it needs more than a database entry. The World Agent gives voice to presences.

**Conditions** (state values, constraint rules, implication chains) — entities whose communicability is primarily through their effects on other things. The economy, the weather, the season, the political situation. These are modeled as world state and managed by the World Agent's constraint framework. They communicate through the Narrator's rendering of their consequences.

**Props** (minimal representation, scene decoration) — entities present in a scene without narrative significance. The chair, the road, the cloud. They require no special modeling — they are part of the scene's texture, available if the narrative or the player elevates them, but not tracked. A prop becomes a presence when the story touches it with enough weight (the chair becomes *the dead woman's chair*, the road becomes *the road home*).

The boundaries between these categories are fluid. The whole point of the gradient is that entities can move along it as the story develops. The ring on the table is a prop until someone notices it; then it is a presence; then, if it carries enough narrative weight and history, it approaches the communicability of a character — not because it speaks, but because the story has given it a voice through accumulation of meaning.

### The World Agent as Translator

This framework reframes the World Agent's role. It is not merely a constraint enforcer — a referee checking whether actions are physically possible. It is the *translator* for everything in the world that is not a character. The World Agent is the voice of the mountain, the river, the weather, the economy, the built environment. It renders their communicability into a form that the Narrator can use and the other agents can reason about.

When the World Agent reports that the stream is running high after three days of rain, it is not just providing a constraint ("you cannot cross here"). It is translating the stream's current state — its swollen urgency, its indifference to human plans, its relationship to the weather that fed it — into information that participates in the narrative. The Narrator then renders this into prose that the player experiences as a world that is alive, responsive, and possessed of its own logic.

### On the Limits of This Framework

We are not claiming that mountains have feelings or that rivers make choices. We are claiming that the binary of "entity with agency" and "inert data" fails to capture something that good fiction has always known: that the non-human world participates in the story not as backdrop but as presence, and that this participation exists on a spectrum from the barely perceptible (the quality of light at dusk) to the overwhelming (the earthquake that levels the city).

The system need not model this participation at every level of the gradient. It need only avoid foreclosing it — avoid designing an architecture that can only see characters and props, agents and databases, the minded and the mute. The gradient is a commitment to leaving room for the mountain to walk, even if we only model its walking when the story requires it.

## On the Vulnerability of World-Making

There is a final thing to say about worldbuilding, and it is not technical.

Building a world is an act of creative exposure. The designer shows us what they think is beautiful, what they think is terrible, what they think is worth fighting for, and what they think is lost. The world carries the watermark of the person who made it. To share a world is to share a vision of what matters — and to risk seeing that vision handled carelessly.

The system must honor this. The agents who inhabit a designer's world are guests in a space that someone cared about. The Narrator who describes the fishing village, the Character Agent who inhabits the innkeeper, the World Agent who knows the weather and the trade routes — all of them are entrusted with something that belongs to someone.

This is not a constraint on the system's behavior. It is the reason the system exists: to take what a designer has made and make it *more* — more alive, more surprising, more resonant than the designer alone could achieve. But "more" in the direction the designer has indicated. More coherent. More real. More worthy of the attention and vulnerability that went into its making.

The best collaborator is not the one who takes over. It is the one who listens deeply enough to offer something the creator recognizes as true — something they didn't know they meant until someone showed it to them. That is the aspiration for every agent in this system, and it begins with respect for the world the designer has built.
