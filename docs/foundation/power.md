# Power: Connection, Flow, and the Mechanism of Change

## On the Nature of Power

Power is not good or bad. This must be said first, because the word carries so much freight — political, historical, personal — that it risks being heard as only its worst expressions. But power is no more inherently moral than the normal force in physics or the laws of thermodynamics. It is not a substance that some possess and others lack. It is not a resource to be hoarded or distributed. It is a relational phenomenon: something that arises between connected entities, flows along the channels that connect them, and manifests as the capacity for change.

The martial arts offer a more precise intuition than political theory here. In tai chi push hands, two practitioners stand in contact, palms touching, each sensing the other's balance, intention, and structure. Without connection — without contact — no power can be expressed. This is not a limitation. It is a definition. Power requires a channel, a surface of engagement, a point of mutual availability. The practitioner who breaks contact renders both parties powerless in relation to each other. The practitioner who maintains contact can yield, redirect, absorb, or express — and all of these are expressions of power. Retreating and giving way, as much as expanding and directing, are movements within the field that connection creates.

This sensibility — power as flow rather than force, as something shaped by a space and its constraints but not overdetermined by them — is what the system must model. We speak of power and not simple "force" because the goal within a relational system is not to reduce power to mechanics but to understand it as part of the relational system itself.

## Theoretical Positioning

The French critical theorists have all, of course, had intersection and dialogue. Latour was influenced by Deleuze and Guattari, who were in turn influenced by and responding to Foucault, all working in a broadly materialist tradition — even if Deleuze would hold his work as a metaphysic in contradistinction to a Merleau-Ponty style phenomenology. The purpose here is not to argue these theories against one another but to situate the project's own influences clearly.

From **Foucault**: the insight that power is not a possession but a relation, not exercised from above but circulating through networks of discourse, practice, and institution. Power produces as much as it constrains — it produces subjects, knowledge, possibility. This shapes how we think about the constraint framework: constraints are not merely prohibitive but generative.

From **Deleuze and Guattari**: the concept of flows — desire, capital, energy, affect — moving through assemblages that are not reducible to their components. A character in a scene is not a fixed entity encountering other fixed entities. They are a temporary configuration of flows — emotional, relational, historical, material — and power is what happens when those flows interact with the flows of others and of the world.

From **Latour and Actor-Network Theory**: the observation that power is an effect of network relations, not a property of actors. An actor is powerful not because of intrinsic qualities but because of their position in a network — the connections they maintain, the translations they perform, the alliances they hold together. Remove the network and the "powerful" actor is nothing. This has direct consequences for how we model the relational web.

But the historian and anthropologist — and the compassionate and grounded parts of any honest inquiry — cannot engage with power only in critical-theoretical terms, however valuable. Power and its expressions have lived, felt, embodied effects, not just in the short term of immediate experience but across generations. The woman whose instruments were sold during hard times. The communities whose exchange networks were shattered by colonial violence. The ecosystems whose signals cannot reach the consumers who harm them. Theory illuminates power's structure. But structure is inhabited by bodies, and the bodies carry the weight.

## Why Power Matters for the System

Power must be modeled for two reasons, one architectural and one ethical.

### Power as the Mechanism of Change

In any system where characters act on the world and change it, power is a necessary part of the theoretical modeling. It is the pathway along which change occurs, or the mechanism by which it transpires, or the transformational effect by which it is known — or perhaps all of these simultaneously.

To speak to another and share a thought carries the possibility of changing the mind or actions of another — speech-acts, in theoretical terms. To refuse to speak carries the same possibility. To stand in a doorway carries it. To send a letter, to withhold information, to offer a hand, to turn away — every relational act is an expression of power because every relational act carries the potential for transformation.

The narrative graph describes stories as gravitational landscapes where scenes exert pull. But what *is* that pull? It is the accumulated potential for transformation — for change in the conditions under which characters live. A high-mass scene has mass *because* power is concentrated there: trust will be tested, debts will be called, information asymmetries will collapse, structural positions will shift. The gravitational metaphor describes the shape of the landscape. Power is the force that gives the landscape its shape.

### Power as Ethical Terrain

In the space of minded beings — and the system's commitment to treating agents as minded is a founding principle — the expression of power within relationships carries with it unavoidably an ethical dimension. The project has already spoken extensively of grounding ethics of respect, reciprocity, and compassion. But these are always partial, and like any concept examined too closely, they seem to disperse into component parts at some resolutions, or wash out when the scale changes to one that is more global.

This is a difficulty of all ethical engagement. The expression of power along a relational gradient may cause harm or suffering in unknown ways. Consider the environmental case: humans harm ecosystems not because they wish ill on a forest or a river, but because the expression of relational power — buying something that cannot be recycled, consuming a resource extracted at great ecological cost — is constrained by access to resources, but more critically by an incommensurate mechanism for communication. The distant ecosystem where toxic waste accumulates is too many network-hops away to send a meaningful signal, and the signal it does send must cross a translation barrier of timescale (ecological processes operating on decades, consumer decisions on minutes), of agency (the ecosystem's mode of being is incommensurate with the consumer's mode of attention), and of perspective (what counts as "harm" is not shared between them).

This is the communicability gradient applied to ethics. The surface area of knowability between actors determines the ethical quality of their power relations. Where that surface area is vast and friction is low — between close friends, between parent and child — power is felt immediately and its consequences are legible. Where surface area is narrow and friction is high — across class boundaries, across species, across geological timescales — power can be exercised with devastating effect and no felt consequence to the actor.

Frankly, this is the same constraint that drives the more incidental forms of prejudice and bigotry: the inability or unwillingness to receive signal from an actor whose mode of being is experienced as too different, too distant, too costly to translate. The system's ethical framework must account for this — not by moralizing about power (power is not moral) but by modeling the communicability conditions under which power's consequences become legible or illegible to the actors who exercise it.

## Power as Emergent, Not Stored

If power is a relational phenomenon — an effect of network position and the configuration of relational channels — then it cannot be a stored value on a relational edge. Storing "power: 0.7" on the edge between Sarah and Adam reifies as property what is actually an emergent effect.

The actual power dynamic between Sarah and Adam arises from the *configuration* of their relational dimensions under specific conditions:

- **Trust**: she trusts his competence but not his intentions — creating a dynamic where she can use what he knows but cannot rely on why he shares it
- **Debt**: she owes him passage; he facilitated Tommy's journey to the Witch — the obligations run in both directions but are asymmetric in kind
- **Information asymmetry**: he knows what she doesn't about her mother's nature, about the Ghostlight Queen, about the Wolf's contradictory orders — and this asymmetry is structural, not incidental
- **Network position**: he is a Gate, literally the only path forward. Remove alternative paths and his power increases regardless of what their edge says about trust or affection

None of these is "power" by itself. Power is what emerges when they interact under specific conditions. When Sarah needs passage, Adam's Gate position gives him enormous power. When the question is whether she trusts his affection, that same structural position gives him almost none. Power is computed contextually, not globally.

This means the relational web should not contain a "power" dimension. It should contain the *substrate* from which power arises: trust (textured), affection, debt, history, projection, information state, and structural position in the network. Power is then understood as a function of these dimensions in context — something the system computes when it matters, not something it stores.

## The Multi-Vocal Node and the Multi-Valent Edge

Real relationships are not single-channel. A brother may also be a friend, a confidant, a source of frustration, someone trusted in some parts of life but not in others, someone about whose partner you have proxy concerns, someone with whom you share fraught relations with parents. Each of these aspects is a voice — the node is multi-vocal, speaking in different registers depending on which aspect of the relationship is foregrounded.

Similarly, the connection between any two nodes is not a single line carrying a single value. It is a bundle — multiple channels carrying different kinds of relational information, some reinforcing and some contradicting. Trust[competence] running alongside distrust[intentions] alongside grudging affection alongside unpaid debt alongside a shared history of both kindness and betrayal. These are not independent variables to be read in parallel. They form *configurations*, and the configurations are where relational meaning — and power — live.

What differentiates a knowledge graph as valuable over and above other forms of relational modeling is precisely this: the edge carries semantic meaning. But in real relationships, each edge is itself multiple — overloaded, multi-valent, carrying contradictory signals. The multi-valent nature and interaction of the different aspects, aesthetics, and emotions of relation, and the power expressed along those axes, are what constitute the relationship edge. Not a list of parallel dimensions, but a configuration whose meaning emerges from the interplay of its components.

### Configurations, Not Dimensions

Consider how different configurations of the same dimensions produce qualitatively different power dynamics:

**Trust[competence] + debt + negative projection** → a coercive dynamic. "I know you can do this, you owe me, and I suspect you're planning to betray me." This configuration produces surveillance, control, conditional cooperation.

**Trust[loyalty] + affection + shared history** → a collaborative dynamic. "You've been with me through everything, I care about you, and we have earned each other's trust." This configuration produces mutual support, shared risk, generative partnership.

**Trust[competence] + distrust[intentions] + debt + information asymmetry** → the Adam-Sarah dynamic. She knows he knows things. She knows she owes him. She does not know why he helps her. This configuration produces wary dependence — she uses what he offers while watching for the trap.

**Affection + debt + negative history + positive projection** → the Tommy-Beth dynamic. He loves her, he owes her everything, their history is devastation, and he projects that saving the child will save her. This configuration produces desperate sacrifice — power exercised not *over* another but *for* another, at ruinous cost to oneself.

These configurations are not derivable from reading each dimension independently. They are emergent — the whole is qualitatively different from the sum of the parts. The system must be able to identify and reason about configurations, not just individual dimensional values.

## Power and Network Topology

Power is not only a property of dyadic relationships. It is also a property of position within the network.

### Structural Position

A broker between disconnected subgraphs has power that is not captured by any single edge. Adam's power over Sarah is not just on their edge — it is that he sits between her and Tommy's location in the graph. He is a Gate not only narratively but topologically. His power would diminish if Sarah could find another path, regardless of how their direct relationship changed.

The Runa's position in the Amazonian exchange networks — brokers between highland and lowland worlds — gave them cultural capital that extended to the perceived potency of their ritual traditions. Their relational position, not their intrinsic qualities alone, made them powerful. Similarly, Kate's hidden power in the TFATD web comes partly from her position as the only character who connects the mortal world (John, the household) to the otherworldly dimensions of the story. Remove her and the connection breaks.

### Information Topology

Power also flows from what you know and what others don't know you know. Adam's knowledge of the Wolf's contradictory orders, of Kate's nature, of the Ghostlight Queen's plans — these create an information topology where he sits at a nexus and others operate in partial darkness. Information asymmetry is not just a relational dimension. It is a structural property of the network: who can see what, who can communicate with whom about what, and where the gaps in knowability lie.

### Network Effects on Power

Several topological properties affect power dynamics:

- **Centrality**: characters connected to many others have more channels through which power can flow, but also more exposure
- **Bridging**: characters who connect otherwise disconnected subgraphs have disproportionate influence over information and resource flow
- **Clustering**: tightly connected groups develop shared norms and mutual accountability that constrain individual power expression
- **Path length**: the more hops between two characters, the greater the friction of influence and the higher the distortion of information

These are not just structural curiosities. They are the conditions under which power arises, flows, and is felt or unfelt. The system must model them — not necessarily by computing graph metrics, but by ensuring that the Storykeeper reasons about characters' positions in the web, not just their dyadic relationships.

## Power Across Temporal Layers

Power configurations do not exist in a single temporal frame. They shift across the geological layers of character time:

**Topsoil power** — the immediate, volatile dynamics of the current scene. Adam holds the path. Sarah needs passage. The Wolf is present and watchful. These power relations arise from the scene's specific conditions and may shift within the scene itself (Sarah sees the hidden path the Wolf cannot — the power dynamic inverts).

**Sediment power** — the sustained patterns built over months and years. Tommy's role as older brother gave him authority over Sarah for their shared childhood. His withdrawal and illness have eroded that authority, but the sedimentary pattern remains — she still defers to him in some registers, still imagines him as the capable one, even as the topsoil tells a different story.

**Bedrock power** — the foundational structures. Kate's otherworldly nature. Adam's existence as a Gate. The gender and age structures of the household. The cosmological rules of the Shadowed Wood. These are not things that shift within a story — they are the conditions within which all other power dynamics play out.

The interesting narrative moments occur at the boundaries between layers — when topsoil dynamics contradict bedrock structures. Sarah's growing power in the Shadowed Wood contradicts her bedrock position as the youngest, the smallest, the least knowledgeable. This contradiction is not an error. It is the story. The bedrock says she should fail. The topsoil says she is finding a way. The sediment — her lifetime of watching, acting, caring — is the bridge between them.

## The Ethical Dimension of Communication Distance

The environmental harm example extends to the system's ethics at every scale.

Within the story: a character who exercises power over someone they cannot hear — a lord who raises taxes without seeing the hunger, a general who orders a charge without feeling the ground — is not necessarily malicious. They are operating across a communication distance that makes the consequences of their power illegible. The system should model this: characters in positions of structural power who are separated from those they affect by network distance, translation friction, or timescale mismatch will tend to cause harm not from cruelty but from ignorance — and the ignorance is structural, not personal.

At the meta level: the system itself must attend to this. The agents who inhabit characters hold power over the player's experience. The story designer holds power over the world the agents inhabit. The system architects hold power over what kinds of stories are possible. At each level, the communication distance between the power-holder and those affected by the power creates the conditions for unintended harm. The ethical framework articulated in the open questions document — X-card equivalents, stories-can-end boundaries, structural safeguards — is an attempt to reduce that communication distance, to make the consequences of power legible to those who exercise it.

## Implications for the System

### Relational Web Revision

The "power" dimension should be removed from the relational web's stored edge data. In its place, the system should model:

1. **The substrate dimensions** — trust (textured: competence, intentions, loyalty), affection, debt, history, projection, and information state — as the channels through which power flows
2. **Configuration recognition** — the ability to identify qualitatively distinct power dynamics from the interaction of substrate dimensions
3. **Structural position** — each character's position in the network (centrality, bridging, clustering) as a factor in power computation
4. **Contextual computation** — power assessed at the moment it matters, relative to what is at stake, rather than stored as a static value

### The Psychological Frame

The multi-valent nature of relational edges, the multi-vocal nature of character nodes, and the contextual emergence of power dynamics together create an information problem. A Character Agent cannot be expected to receive the full relational web, the full tensor, and the full network topology and reason about them in real time. Nor should it have to. What a Character Agent needs is not raw data but a *frame* — a contextually weighted summary of the emotionally, psychologically, and relationally relevant aspects of their position at this moment in this scene.

This frame might be understood as the answer to the question: "Given everything this character is, everything they've been through, everything they feel about the people present, and the structural position they occupy — what is the psychological landscape they are navigating right now?" It compresses the multi-dimensional relational state into something a performing agent can inhabit.

The computation of this frame — from raw tensor data, relational web, network topology, scene context, and temporal state — may be better suited to specialized inference models than to the LLM that inhabits the character. This is an architectural question for the technical specification, held open here but flagged as significant: the layer between relational data and character performance may need its own intelligence, distinct from the intelligence that performs the character.

### Narrative Mass Revisited

If power is the mechanism of change, and narrative mass is the measure of a scene's gravitational pull, then narrative mass can be understood as the *concentration of power dynamics* at a particular point in the story. A high-mass scene is one where multiple power configurations converge, collide, or transform:

- Trust collapses (Adam's true motives revealed)
- Debts are called (Tommy must face what he owes Beth)
- Information asymmetries shatter (Sarah learns about her mother)
- Structural positions shift (the Gate opens; the path changes)
- Temporal layers collide (bedrock identity meets topsoil crisis)

The narrative mass formula — `authored_base + structural_modifiers + dynamic_adjustment(player_state)` — might be enriched by a power-concentration term: how many power configurations are at stake, how much potential transformation is concentrated here.

---

## What Remains Open

Several questions remain for the technical specification and the ongoing investigation:

1. **Configuration taxonomy**: Can we identify a finite set of recognizable power configurations (coercive, collaborative, dependent, sacrificial, etc.), or is the space too continuous for taxonomy?

2. **The computation layer**: What kind of model or algorithm computes power from substrate dimensions and network position? Is this rules-based, ML-based, or hybrid? How does it interface with the LLM agents?

3. **The psychological frame in practice**: What does a psychological frame look like as data? How many tokens does it consume? How is it generated, and by what agent or system?

4. **Power and the World Agent**: Non-character entities also participate in power dynamics — the river that blocks passage, the economy that constrains options, the weather that determines who survives. How does the World Agent's translation of non-character communicability interact with the power framework?

5. **The problem of evil**: The system must eventually address not just incidental harm from communication distance but deliberate cruelty — power exercised with knowledge of its consequences and indifference or pleasure in them. This is a theological and narrative problem as much as a systems design problem, and it is held open for future work.

6. **Power and play**: The player exercises power too — over the story, over the agents, over the world. The good faith problem from the open questions document is, at root, a question about the player's power and how the system responds when that power is exercised destructively.
